Losing hope day after day
The Weight
Want to kill myself so my father will feel pain
The lowest I've been...
Have I earned it?
Why and Why not
The Forgotten Wife
Ready to be at peace
She would be happier without me
Falling Apart
How to get hope.
No way out
I had a nightmare
i want to live
Difficult to deal with
I can't handle this
I harmed myself today
Born to self sabotage
I have given up(a tale about my sad life)
I wish I would die
I wish i was dead
Spiraling down the hole. Seeking Guidance
I feel so alone and awful all the time
It keeps getting worse
Rejected by every school.
My story
Living Just to Live
Question
Unsure
Frustrated beyond frustration...
I need help. :(
Can't think of any other way out
Have to die
Tried the other day.
Its back again......
No point of living

The Devastating Reality
Might have triggers. But a very long story about my depression so far.
I have nothing to live for
Don't even care anymore

Suicidal urges
I want to do it...
Bother

Why Can't I Just Die?
What's the point?

Dark place
Seriously considering it

More and more
The end is near
I'm trying so hard..... I feel so low right now....
Just want to talk..

No help
I didn't ask to be born.  So why suffer?
"still alive, unfortunately"
So miserable...
Not sure what to do anymore
No life *trigger*
I need to do it
Weird dream...
Praying for death
"First time in my life, suicide seems the only thing to do"
If I only could end this
Fuckin had enough
It's always the same as the last...
What's the point?
I hate being alive
Feeling so lost about my purpose in life.
I am just full of words
5 words
All I wanna be is done.
Sigh.

My severe Depression
"No body cares, Ihave never felt this alone before, hurting so much, help me? x"
having a bad day-
Comfortable with Suicidal Thoughts
harder harder and harder to fight
"This is the strongest I have ever felt the need to die, and I'm scared."
Could someone give me a good reason for me to stay alive?
"I beg you, God, for mercy."
It's back and...
help...
Stopping thoughts
Dark thoughts have resurfaced
i am not going to continue much longer
hello
please help.. someone :(
it makes more sense
"Suicidal feelings, troubles, situations, and challenges."
"My life is good, but..."

Why am I still here?
Failure is what i am
Beaten and overwhelmed
feeling suicidal
Friend wanting to commit sucide over loss of a relationship.
Pretending to live
The two essentials that can never be.
I am drowning
Tired of being alive
Enough is enough
Hopeless...
too much frustration
I don't know what to do anymore
But my partner...
Want to quit
I have been harassed for 6 yrs I want to die.
Just another...
I would like some thoughts about my situation.
I'm in need of some help.
I no longer fear death because I don't care anymore
cant see myself alive 4 years from now
Why even try?
Life is pathetic
Suicidal Without Depression?
Tired. Sad. Stupid day.
"Not suicidal, but lacking a reason to exist"
Suicidal Now More Than Ever (warning: religious content)
"Plenty to Live For, But Nothing At All"
Nobody cares
Song I listen to while suicidal
Curious
i dread the future
Can anyone hear me?
I want to die tell me what is the point in living?
Every day I think about suicide
Removing the subjectivity
Can't stop thinking about it...
Hey
Maybe death is the answer
Hate living in my own skin...
Cant't Stop Wishing For The End
this is the hardest thing I've ever wrote
Hate everything.
What if...
I've been contemplating for several years
Will it go?
on my mind
Suicide because Hair Loss
Being dragged back to suicidal thoughts
There is nothing left
Tonight
Bored to death
"New year, same shit."
Nothing ever goes right
Clutching at straws
Can't Take it Anymore
I can't be the only one thinking this.
Friend was Potentially Suicidal- Weird Family Lashed Out at Me
Feeling stupid & like a failure
Choose wisely?
A POEM ABOUT SUICIDE
Any advice?
Long time since I've felt like this.
How did I get here?
"I don't even want to die... It's just easier than living,"
I was final better...
just need someone to talk to
My life feels so dark.
How to talk to your family about suicide
At least it's consistent...
the reality
I should kill myself
lone wolf sectioned
I wish I wasn't trash
Should I leave behind a .....
I am better off dead
It's everyone elses fault
I don't know what is wrong with me
If I had any motivation left it's gone now
No One Takes Me Seriously
Just existing.
MY lowest point
What's the point
Eventually
Can I call the hotline even if I'm not suicidal?
At that point again...
im not even really sure i need help
why?
when you can't break free
No one to love me
Severe pain
Again....Everything seems pointless.
So tired
Desperately wanting to die
what's the point.
I'm finished.
Enough...
i have figured it out
Seriously contemplating suicide
i´ve lost everything
Everything is falling apart
Wishing for a quick ending
Why Not?
Why I Desire Death
Not too sure.
I feel like a financial burden and it's making me suicidal
No point in existing anymore
Suicide seems like the only answer
16 year old with mental issues
Not really suicidal
Don't fit in anywhere
15 and it seems as if dying is my only option
"I don't feel suicidal now, but..."
"I want to die, but not suicidal. Confusing"
made to suffer
What do I even do anymore?
Nobody likes me
no social life need any advice and help please
lost and tired.
Hard Night
I think about suicide every day
Extreme Caution
i hate life
distant...
I dont care anymore I want to die
Ready for it
i don't deserve to life
"My life,i want end with it"
Life just isn't enjoyable
a fresh start?
I don't know what to do anymore
Hey
Just feeling hopeless
"life is a bitch, can you help?"
"Is thinking about death and dying similar to ""suicide""?"
It's not 'if'.. It's 'when'..
Just so you know...
Just can't anymore.
No where else to turn
No social life and nobody cares about me what do I do?
Don't understand how people can be like this
I want to do it
"Im back, and i need friends"
Sometime lurker and in a dark place
Life without love
Even if I killed myself nobody would care
I Need A Lot Of Help This Is It
"I have no one to talk to, just need 1 person to listen."
i will always be this way so what's the point
"No friends, no love, boring life what to do?"
My boredom is killing me
I had a good run
Has anyone been suicidal all their life?
I feel blue and I am sick
suicidal
I no longer see the reason to live
is it okay if what i say doesnt make sense? hrm :/
What is going on
just wanted to explain :/
Do not want to live
Thankful
Expressing it...finally.
I deserve to die
Again :(
Still struggling...for years
broken
7 years later and this is how I feel (rough night)- angry rant-trigger?
It's time (possible trigger)

The end

Family and Friends
Thoughts about Pre-suicide
Annoyed & Scared

I feel like attempting suicide
It is not a thought
It Just Pops Into My Head
I really need some advice please
I'm crying because nobody cares about me
I feel inferior and depressed because I'm not white
I don't know what to do
I feel stuck
I haven't been happy for a long time
So....
Life and University
Why can't I move on an be happy?
This planet terrifies me
Trying to work out conflicting feelings
What is it about me that makes me so unimportant?
Living on the edge and i feel like everyones pushing me
Somebody please please help me
That sinking feeling
Abnormal= easy way to die = Suicidal = spiritual attacks.
Long story short..
"I'm at the lowest point I've ever been, I need desperate advice, I'm crying all alone"
Feeling bad
it never goes my way...
I pray for the end to come
I don't belong in this world
My life is hopeless
Someone help me to give this message
Failure is a terrible weight to bear
Lost and confused
I have Nothing
Somebody tell me the truth
My life is garbage and I have nobody. Need desperate help
life story
Irritated to say the least
Don't want to be around for too much longer..
Life hurts too much
Is there anything left?
Are there times it is better not to mention and just do it?

It still hasn't gotten better
Can't do it

I wanna do it
The thought of ending it gets easier for each passing day
