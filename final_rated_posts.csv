1@@I've found myself in a hole that I can't crawl out from and I'm losing hope day after day. There isn't really anyone I could talk to because I know I would receive the typical responses that I would get, ""That's selfish, why would want to do that, it'll get better"". For me it feels like it just keeps getting worst. When it first started the thoughts would just come then go away for a couple months then I would have the feeling again, but starting in the beginning of February of this year, the thoughts have been occurring daily, and the idea of death becomes more demanding. 99% of me wants to cease to exist, while that one percent is just me being terrified about what I might miss out, and that dumb one percent is what is holding me back. I don't even know if I should even forgo that one percent.@@4
2@@ With all the money that is donated to charities for depression and  suicide, what help do they actually offer? Where does the money go  (other than in people's pockets, research, and suicide phone lines)? I need more than venting to a phone line; I need . I know there are prescription discount cards but I am broke. Do any of these charities offer any (financial and/or medicinal) help?@@1
3@@ It's like suffocating....the depression. NolightNoairNospaceNohope. I'm feel completly lost. I don't know who I am anymore. The more I suffer through depression with all the srinks ajusting my meds, the more scars appear on my wrist. I just want to be gone. I already feel dead inside. I'm just human waste product now, dispose of it.@@1
4@@ Human society just disgusts me, some of their attitudes (as expressed through main-stream media) just seems so wrong to me... This whole horse-meat fiasco happening in the UK, and the media and government's attitude just disgusts me even more . Nobody questions the ethics of murdering any animal they are just worried whether the horse had some drugs in its system (that humans forcibly injected or fed to it anyway to maximise the meat on the animal) before they ate it. In the end there was a neglible risk to humans, but there was still a huge uproar none the less because it wasn't labelled as horsemeat - the people don't seem to give a shit about the welfare of the animal or ethics of the meat industry . These animals never wanted to be enslaved and murdered when they were in the prime of their life, I am sure they would have wanted to live a free and full life in the wild instead! I just can't fathom humans' indifference to non-humans but utter hysterical behaviour when it comes to human welfare and ethics e.g. on suicide or if a person wants help to end their own life due to illness, physical disability or utterly shit situation. It just seems like they are a bunch of hypocrytical fucks! Am I the only one that feels this way@@5
5@@ I really don't care about anything anymore to the point where I no longer care about trying to cheer myself up, or doing anything to make myself comfortable, or happier. To explain a bit about how I got here let me start by saying it's been a very long time since I have been genuinely happy, and the few times I have been happy it's for a short time and it's always followed by way more sadness. I'm 17 now, I finished high school last june, a year younger because I skipped a grade. At high school I had almost no real friends, and there's nobody from there now that I could consider a real friend. What makes it worse is that it was an all-guys school, so not only do I have no male friends but I barely even know any girls. Growing up, I had no real friends, an abusive father, both my parents focused me solely on school, never any physical activities so I'm scrawny on top of everything else. I always told myself that being unhappy was just temporary and this was just a shitty phase in my life and things would be better when I went to university but that made things even worse. I moved to a school 8 hours away, the only person I knew there was pretty much one of my only friends from high school.  I only managed to stay there for a semester though, I have very bad ADD, but despite being diagnosed, my parents wouldn't get me any medication saying they thought it was bad for me and that I was just faking it and didn't really need any medication, I was just lazy and needed to work harder. Because of my ADD I find it next to impossible to sit down and do school work which means I always underachieve which is a shame because I feel like I'm actually intelligent if I could find the ability to do the work. Anyways, going to university only made things worse. My mom's the only person I care about in the world and if being away from her wasn't hard enough, my dad called and told me that my mom's dying from high blood pressure. He told me that it's all my fault, her blood pressures rising because she's worried about me. At the same time the only girl I've ever liked a) hooked up and started dating the so-called friend from high school, and b) started telling me she was depressed and suicidal and needed my help. I still cared about her a lot even though she had literally just broken my heart so I helped her as best as I could as a friend and got her through it. A couple of weeks later in December she breaks up with my old friend and starts seeing me. I told her from the beginning that I loved her but that I was worried because she really could hurt me, but I cared so much I trusted her and opened myself up to her again. Now during this entire process, I also started smoking weed daily, it became one of the only things that could relax me and help take away some of my depression. By Christmas time, because of all the anxiety, depression, ADD, and a whole host of other problems I had failed 2 of my 5 courses. My parents pulled me out of school on January the 5th. I had to move back in with my parents, of course, my parents blamed me, and the weed for me failing and even kicked me out of the house for 3 weeks. I spent most of the time at a friends house (also no longer a friend, and he was literally the last one I had). I moved back in with my parents house after spending 3 days living homeless. During these 3 weeks I needed to steal from grocery store's just to have something to eat, otherwise I'd have literally starved. I only moved back in with my parents house after I got caught stealing from a store and the police called them for me. Suicide's something that I've thought about my entire life. When I was younger it used to be once or twice a year, but the frequency of the thoughts have been increasing constantly, and ever since my parents pulled me out of school there hasn't been a single day I haven't thought about just killing myself to end all this shit. I feel like my life's useless and a waste of time, I don't see anything ever going right for me. Of course the girl I cared about dumped me after I had to move 8 hours a day, but if that wasn't hard enough today she started fucking with my head even more texting me telling me she misses me and shit like that. I'm just so tired of living now, I literally don't care about anything, going back to school, getting back with her, getting a job, I don't give a shit about any of it. I have no motivation, nothing I care about, it's all meaningless to me, there isn't anything I value and even though I want there to be somebody that I could care about deeply there really isn't, I'm that lonely.@@2
6@@ I'm finally crying just now, at the realisation that I will be forever be rejected and shunned. I just can't do it anymore. Sorry. All I need now is to work up the courage. This life isn't for me. Why can't I just die now? Why can't I just click my fingers and be gone? I can't do it. I don't want to go on. Please kill me@@1
7@@ [I look at my scars and see something else: a girl who was trying to cope with something horrible that she should never have had to live through at all. My scars show pain and suffering, but they also show my will to survive. They're part of my history that'll always be there]@@1
8@@ I thought that we could have are own  group therapy. I had one scheduled for Dec, 5 at the hospital, but by the time it finally came up after signing 6 months earlier, I couldn't leave the house because of my depression. So I thought we could form one of are own. I don't know if there's already something like this on the forum, but I couldn't find one, and I wanted to put one in the suicide forum. I thought we could share different experiences. Not exactly suicide attempt, but there welcome of course. But there's so many people and incidences that you, I,  or whoever that didn't do it. sometimes I wonder why don't I just do it. But I don't think that's what myself or anyone else is on this planet, so instead of doing it, I thought we all could talk. It doesn't have to be about suicide attempts, anyone is welcome of course to talk about it, but I thought that we could talk about experiences where we, you felt constantly that you felt like you had to do it but didn't because you knew or thought, or felt like you shouldn't. I want to hear why people who feel like they should but haven't because you felt like there was still more for you in this world. I heard that the best thing to do is find people who have had similar experiences, and talk to them, and share reasons why you didn't do it, or became happier. I think I could go on forever but I hope a lot of people join in, I think we could all benefit from this kind of discussion.@@5
9@@ I can't take it anymore. I might as well end it all....@@2
10@@ Even after calling the police over my reaction to an argument last month, she doesn't give a fuck what she's doing to our money. Our bank account is at -13, even with the overdraft protection disabled. She just asked me for $100-something to lend to her boyfriend. When I said I didn't have it, she said he'll take anything. I asked why she couldn't pay him, and she claimed she doesn't have anything. This is a bitch who spent $200 on a ladder for him. Last month, she bought a used car just days after calling the police on me for my reaction to another instance of her overspending. And she literally spent hundreds of dollars all month in preparation for her upcoming birthday. And she doesn't give a fuck about all of this. She calmly explained that she's getting another pension check. And when that happens (on the 28th), there will be no more debts. She says this every fucking month. Now would be a perfect time to die. Why can't death be painless, or at least easier? Why do people insist on keeping easy ways to die out of the public hands? If I want to die, it's nobody else's fucking business.@@3
11@@ i hate people. i was surfing the web and i came acrossed this thing that said ""hey all you cutters, stop cutting your wrists and slit your throut instead"" it pissed me the fuck off!!! like, who the hell says that so millions of people who they dont even fucking know?!? come the fuck on! how much balls do you have if you can say that??? i know how much, less than me!!! and im a fucking girl asshole!!! and you have less balls than me you motherfucking son of a bitch!!! it just pisses me off!!! i hope that whoever put that there reads this because i want them to know how pissed i am!!! thats like saying that bugs should all die because theyre all gross! your just making a stupid asumption that all cutters are horrid people who need to die. well guess what? if every cutter/self mutilator went out and killed them self, half the fucking world would be fucking dead! FUCK YOU ASSHOLE!!!!!! xoxo freddie girl@@4
12@@ I feel pretty terrible tonight. All I can think about is dying. And I see this happening, in the very near future. I don't know what to do anymore. I tried meds. No luck. I tried therapy. No luck. I even tried hospitalisation. Still no luck. So what else can I do? Thats why all I can see is death. I want nothing else anymore. I truly give up. I'm going to do it properly this time.@@1
13@@ i have a prime oppurtunity to go and die right now why dont i take it :(@@1
14@@ So far, my depression thoughts have lowered a bit... and my suicidal thoughts are decreasing... but it's still there, I feel like i'm just suppressing it... waiting for it to burst until I have another mental breakdown... I dont remember how many breakdowns i've had... but I remember one, it was on a school day and it was lunch... the night before I wrote on a piece of paper about how I felt about myself, how I suck, why I shouldnt be alive, and so on... a good friend of mine visited my classroom and sat beside me, I told her a bit how I felt shitty and showed her the piece of paper... As she read it, I felt like everything locked up inside me broke out, I panic and my mind was so foggy... then I started crying... and I don't like crying... and I didn't know why I was crying, they say it was a mental breakdown... I dont want another mental breakdown... i'm not really sure what to do now... I don't want to talk to my friend about this, cause I think I'll just cause her trouble and I think I'll start crying again... and I've been having way to much mood swings lately... it sucks... I dont want to attempt suicide again, I haven't told anyone or i wont... I'm scared of what they would think, what would happen to me, I dont want therapy, I dont want the attention, I dont want people telling me the same shit over and over again, I dont know what I want....@@3
15@@ I have been dealing with chronic pain in my feet and neck for several years. I take pain medication for them. Some days it helps well, some days ok. On top of this I deal with depression and anxiety. I have 3 suicide attempts in the past. Lately I have felt real hopeless and lonely. I broke up with my girlfriend about 2 years ago after 11 years. I now have to count on me for support in all my issues. I feel like not living anymore. Why bother. It seems like even my parents don't care about me in there actions towards me. I see my doctors and have been talking to my therapist on a daily basis lately since things have been hard for me again. I lie to her about how I feel and make sure I am not hospitalized. Thats to much pressure on top of the chronic pain that will not be treated. I am trying to manage on a daily basis. I am Sorry for not being to clear, I am confused and not feeling well@@3
16@@ so, i'm not saying i'm going to commit suicide on my Birthday but, that's all that i can think about. 21days.. left? no? yes? i don't know? my Mother's leaving me to holiday with my boyfriend so, i'll be alone.. i just don't know anymore.@@2
17@@ im sorry i have not been on here for so long. [edit] i just decided about an hour ago that this is it. i know that it is so short and you might think that this will blow over but i dont think so unless something really magical happens. ive been 50/50 on suicide for very long. now its time. my last days on earth are going to feel like a dream. i already feel like this is a dream or something. but it doesnt matter. in death, i will hope to find the true meaning of life and that will mean some suffering after death. God will be mad and i dont blame him. but i believe that God will eventually forgive me after much time. i will have to prove my love for him and i will suffer for what i have done for quite a while but i hope it works out in the end. i have an appointment with my therapist [edit]. in the morning. that will be very interesting as im not sure if i will burst out and say im going to kill myself or not. most likely i wont and just talk about what we talk about. but maybe i wont be able to keep it in and i will admit my plan. im not sure what i will do but it is going to be hard either way. i pretty sure on what method i will choose too. it all comes down to the last hours. suicide is such a stupid selfish decision but that is who i am. im weak, evil, and a coward. that is another reason why i should do it. im not too worried about the pain of it yet but im sure it will get stronger but i need to do what i need to do. i dont want all this to trigger any of you, but i have to admit this. thank you all for being of such great help over the months. but sometimes, even people arent enough.@@1
18@@ Iâ€™m so miserable today. Actually it already started after I had a really wonderful time at the weekend. After this was over, my mood has been changing drastically. I didnâ€™t expect my condition to be so bad these days. Yesterday I even took care of something I wanted to be done for years. But still I feel so bad. I just feel like jumping out of the window right now. Itâ€™s all so pointless. I feel so misunderstood and lonely. I donâ€™t know how to get through just one more day of this type. Every single moment is so hard. I feel like the worst person ever. I feel justâ€¦insane. I donâ€™t know how to live in this world as being me...@@2
19@@ i am so done. i don't want to go through this anymore. i'm done feeling. it is no more. am no more.@@2
20@@ Since I was kid I've been all by myself. My parents had fights every night they came home, and they annihilated the time I could have with them. No talks, no love, no help. They thought the money they used was gonna make me happy. I always had what I wanted, in material terms. But I was not that kind of kid that had fights with his parents to buy something. I almost never ask them something to buy. My brother treated me bad, even if today he's more mature and is more of a friend. Still, he doesn't live with me anymore. I suffered from bullying really early. It was really critical at first, and stopped for 2 years when I moved to another school. Until I got to college. At the first year everything was ok, but this year things got worse. They hit me, they hurt me, not just with words and nicknames. They want to hit me in the heart and make me feel like a victim. Still, I never blew up. My mind is always evolving and I always find someway to resolve those things. I can ignore them, I can forget the fact my parents don't care about me and I can get over the whole shit I've been through until today. But still, there's something in me that is not coming through. When I found out about music, and I got my acoustic guitar, I had a escape valve. Music has always been my best friend (if not my only friend). Poetry, all that. I always try to talk about something that troubles me. And I resolve my problems that way. But when I'm getting bullied, when I talk to someone that might resolve it for me, that might do it the right way, they simply don't try anything. They simply say that they're gonna do something and leave the problems on my hands. And I'm still getting bullied. And everytime I hear what they call me, I understand somethings might be truth. I know who I am, I know exactly who I am. But why I feel so small when I have such a great heart? Why am I so mistreated when I want everyone to feel good about themselves? Why do people hate me, if I love every single one of them? Sometimes I feel like I need someone, to remember me to stay calm, and to remind me that I have someone with me. I don't like being by myself anymore. I'm tired of this. I refuse myself looking at my future again, because I know I'm gonna die by my own hands if this keep going. It's not just a choice, I don't feel like I have to live. I still have my soul and that's what matter. I'm not gonna leave anything in this earth one way or another. Why am I still here? If everytime I help someone, everytime I give them support, they're gonna thank me and start acting like I'm a monster right after? Why do I still laugh because the other people are equal between them, and not different like me? Why is everyone leaving me behind? I never left any of you behind. Why? Why do people wanna see me crying? Why can't I resolve this?@@5
21@@ When I take a walk in the park I often start to make an overview of my well being. While walking I try to concentrate on the music I'm listening to and I try to become more aware of my surroundings and the passing of time. I don't get it.  I'm here to work a job so I can pay the bills I make.  I pay rent so that I have a place to live so that I can work so that I can pay my rent so that I can work.  If I'm not here, then I'm not creating expenses, right? There has to be a reason to be here.  What is it?@@4
22@@ Because I'm often busy with things and thoughts in my head all day long. I try to get outside of my head. Halfway through the walk I can no longer control my thoughts at all. I have a complete breakdown. My concentration drops down to zero. I then start to hallucinate heavily. I don't really think I want to talk about the disgusting things I see. I always have severe headaches when hallucinating. The images in my head are hurting me all the time. I can not even have a normal visualisation anymore. I become aware of the fact that things are not okay at all in my life. I become very sad and depressed. The medication does not work. Once I get another prescription from my doctor it will probably take another 3 months before it will have effect. So that means another 3 months of going to the same hell I've been in for over the last 13 months. I have not made any real plans of how I plan on dying...but I do think about it every day. I want to get rid of these headaches and hallucinations so bad. It's making me very sad.@@4
23@@ as of last year i gave myself about a year or max two (although i don't think i can last as long as 2) to carry on living. my life got messed up so much that i no longer need it. sometimes i think i'll do it sooner esp when i feel low and i remember everything, but since it's not in my plans i'm not ready, no methods ready. don't know why i'm posting if i'm not going to do it this year, just feeling suicidal i guess, and the idea of suicide has been visiting me frequently over the last 6/7 years.. why am i still here i wonder. not that i didn't try, three times, all stupid methods, so was saved. but i wish i wasn't. my mental state deteriorates with years, my dreams never come true, and if they do, something so terrible happens at the same time that i lose it all. i have no education, my biggest scar, because all i wanted to do is study something that i like, but for some reason i encounter so many obstacles that nothing came of it. i've spent years at home, so i have gaps on my cv, and obviously i can't find a job. i feel too old to go to uni i'm 27. but most of all i suffer from OCD, intrusive thoughts i don't like, and even when the illness doesn't bother me and i forget, i live with a thought that i'm not perfect that there is something wrong with me, that i don't deserve anything anyway. i've been humiliated to the core, and recent past took the last out of me... it's not that i can't fight anymore, i just don't want to. if i really were to sit down and write everything to you guys, all that happened you'd be shocked... but it doesn't matter, i just know that i will have to leave one day, and i know it can be scary to think this way but i know i'll be happy on that day..@@4
24@@ i'm so so tired of life.... i fail in everything i do. i have a degree yet in every job i get i screw things up and can't do right. i'll probably get fired from my new job that i got a month ago. i f***ing hate people and can't understand them and can't stand working with them. i have a very low self confidence. basically, i don't fit in any where.... i cant see any bright future for me....i wish i was never born!!!! i don't want to die. i just want the pain to go away...i want to sleep forever. go away from society and dissapear....@@4
25@@ i dont like i'm being controlled by people who hate me and there fighting me an internal battle i just give up :( sorry@@4
26@@ i can't understand what i'm feeling. i feel alone even though i know i am not. i feel sad and i know it's okay to feel sad given what i've been through and i what i have to live with, but i feel very very sad. i can't eat. food just doesn't taste right, it doesn't taste good. my stomach is hungry but food is too hard to make i'm too tired to go through the trouble. i just want to lay in bed and stare at the tv. don't answer the phone because what would i say? i would start crying and then have to give an explanation that the other person on the other end of the phone would not understand anyway. so i don't bother with the phone. i want to just sit here. sit here and cry occassionally.@@4
27@@ I am of the belief that i should have suicided at 16. I am now 63. During all those years I have suffered chronic depression, had numerous treatments, seen many psychiatists, had long term psychotherapy, had CBT/DBT sessions and most antidepressants. The thing is, my daughter now has chronic depression (bipolar 2) and suicidality and all I can see is that she too will have this horrible life. If I'd been euthenased at 16, she wouldn't be going through this too. I do not believe ""things happen for a reason"" etc. I have no faith in treatments. Why should we have to live these lives? There is no point to constant suffering that has no chnce of being relieved.@@4
28@@ I don't plan my future anymore because I don't believe I'll make it that far. It has been 6 months since I tried to kill myself, and it is always in my mind. I'm going to try again. And this time I can't fail. I'm done here.@@4
29@@ I think about killing myself all the time; I lose time at work thinking about it. I know I need help, but I can't talk about it. I only have one friend, and she's great, but I don't want to tell her because I don't want her to blow the whistle. I hate phones - I'm not comfortable with them in any way, so calling a hotline is not something i'll do. I tried emailing the samaritans, but it didn't help; I don't have anything much to say, and I just didn't feel any kind of connection. Ultimately, I found it more frustrating and fake-feeling than anything else... which is not to disparage the people on the other end who are trying to help. They didn't do anything wrong, it's just the consequences of me knowing too much psychology and how to 'deal' with someone who's suicidal. I don't even have any real hope that posting here will help, but I can't seem to stop reaching out. As I said, I think about killing myself all the time. Nothing particularly bad or stressful is going on in my life. There is no trigger. I have clinical depression that goes in cycles, and has as far back as I can remember. I'm never really happy, but I sink into a deep depression about once a month. It's not uncommon for me to contemplate suicide during this time. I've had a plan of one kind or another since I was 16. I don't self-harm though -- i don't feel any relief through pain. The depression has been getting worse though, and this time, even though i'm not in my 'slump' anymore, I still want to die. I just don't see the point of me being alive. I don't contribute anything, I'm not a particularly nice person, I don't have the drive to do anything great. I spend a lot of time complaining and projecting my own inadequacies onto others. I used to enjoy reading, but now I mostly do it because I have nothing else to do. i tried looking for classes or clubs in my area, but there is nothing reachable in my time and budget. I'm extremely lonely; the one friend I mentioned is 2 hours away. I talk to my coworkers at the office, but not as much as most people, and I don't really get to know them. I'm 32, and most people at work are older or younger than me. The ones who are my age aren't interested in making friends because they're busy with their own lives/families. I've tried online dating, but I get either a) creepy people who obviously didn't read my profile and only want a one-night stand, or b) people who seem cool, but then seem too cool, so I can't bring myself to message/ meet them because they'll only be disappointed. i've lost my sex drive, but I really just want someone to hold and love. I haven't changed in all these years, despite knowing I need to and wanting to, so I've realized that at this point, it's clear I never will change.  The thought of being alone and unchanging like this for another 30 years brings me to tears. I've started giving things away in preparation. I'm not in any rush, but I don't think I can go another year.@@2
30@@ Why should I complicate myself with what the others feel? They ignored me, now it's time for me to ignore them. All of my life I've whipped myself in order to become a greater person. I've taken blames that weren't even mine. I shut up even when I had the upper hand. I tried to tell others that they're so irresponsibly stupid. Now, I'm the stupid irresponsible loud mouth idiot. Now, I know what to others is a natural state of being. I don't care, you hear me! I don't fucking care and I'm going to end it soon. I'm going to tear this whole place down because it doesn't deserve to be. It was YOU who made me this way. It was YOU who killed me. Me? There is no me. I never existed. I'm a fraud. I'm nothing and will return to being nothing.@@3
31@@ I've started to have some suicidal thoughts come into my head. It's mostly passive suicidal ideation and having thoughts of wanting to kill myself but they just ""pop"" into my head. I've been feeling very empty and hopeless. But for ""no good reason."" I just got married and I am in my final year of my doctorate (in psychology ironically, which also makes my mind race with all the potential psychological and biological things that could be going on to cause said thoughts.) I have a history of MDD and anxiety, as well cutting and as 3 suicidal attempts when I was a teenager. I hate my life, I am overwhelmed with academic work, my clinical rotation (where I have been sexually harassed, which is triggering because I am sexual abuse survivor). I hate my program and it's values. The people in my class ignore me. I have 3 friends, but they're all as busy as I am and seeing them is next to impossible. I love my job in the mental health field, but with that and all my other responsibilities I usually work 6-7 days a week often working from 630am-9pm or even midnight at least 2 days a week. I just want life to stop. And now I am dealing with these foreign (ego dystonic) thoughts of hurting myself and feelings of how much I hate my life and thinking it just will never get better. :(@@4

I haven't owned a tv for the last IDK 4 years. I sold my 27"" cuz I didn't use it. They rejected my request, in the past I would use the ""chat"" area.

35@@ Hi. I really don;t know much about posting online.  I'm afraid if I stop to rewrite a sentence or spell check I'll quit.  So,I apologize in advance if I ramble or misspell. I just don't have anyone to talk to. And I don't know what to do anymore.  I wonder if anyone will actually even read this.  Not looking to sound melodramatic, but just musing aloud. If I pretend I'm writing to myself maybe I can do this. I'm 34. A mom. A wife. Unemployed. Failed business. School loans for unfinished degree. 3 stepkids who honestly *really* dislike me.  No stepmom syndrome here, they have stolen from me, cut my clothes, and trash my house in little ways. I don't want to die.  I'm just tired of living. Tired of loneliness and fear. Afraid because my daughter is adhd and so am I~and I have contributed to her poor attitude.  Second rate schoolwork. She hates her stepdad(I'm sure he's depressed and has anger issues...lots of previous relationship baggage). She is smart and funny and everything I ever wanted. except she thinks i hate her and she feels bad about her behavior. My husband is awesome. truly loves me and my daughter. constantly worries about money. i feel like a burden.  car wreck and fibromyalgia does not a good worker make! I'm hiding financial info from him, trying to juggle and keep it together.  we are more broke than usual. and no matter the reason, he gets so angry because we just don't make enough money.  and he makes good money, it should be enough.  but if i tell him that I've been floating stuff here and there to try and keep our heads above water, he'll yell~you lied to me (and I guess that, yeah.  I have). what are we going to do? etc, etc...and he'll be disappointed in me.  again, All my life, I've been an outsider. I love life, but hate everything that goes with it.  Even the good things...because I know sooner or later theres a price. I sometimes think if I wasn't here, my daughter could live with her dad.  He's honestly not that bad, we just weren't good for each other (took 8 years to get to this point in our ""relationship"") She would never again worry that I didn't love her.  Never again get yelled at or feel unwanted because I feel depressed. My husband? He won't have to support me, my daughter, or our meds.  He will be able to deal with all the finances himself, and no more strife.  After all, my daughter won't be here to make him feel shitty, and I won't be here so his kids will visit more. No more dealing with bad finances from ME. *poof* not his problem.  No more arguments about attitude, or homework, or picking up after herself. *poof* he'll never have to deal with his stepdaughter again.  No more putting up with my sadness.  Or procrastination. Or my stuff.  (It does tend to go everywhere.  I create art and craft alot.  I honestly thought it would help more.  huh...should've guessed the outcome to that one!) I just don't know what to do anymore.  I don't want to die.  But I just can't live with myself.  I'm afraid.  Even thought about how weekends would be perfect because my daughters gone.  And then I start to miss her and my husband already.  And then I forget.  Until something else happens....something always does. I'm just so tired.@@5
36@@ So, the past couple of months have been fantastic.. The company I work for closed down, and everyone where told they would get the money it owed them, that was until they went bankrupt and nobody gets anything. So everyone will be getting it from the government instead. Which takes anything from 5-12 months. I have no money, my savings account is pretty dry, and getting drier, seeing as I have to eat. The government can't give velfair before this thing with the job is over (which is taking forever), and I have around $1500 in bills/rent due in about 12 days. I'm 35, I haven't been in a real relationship in the past 8 years. Mostly because of two things. One: being diagnosed with a psoriasis, and two being majorly confused about who I am sexually/romantically (at the moment I see myself as pan sexual, but I don't know). Now that my work is gone, I feel I have nothing, work kept me sane so to speak. All my friends are busy with their own lives, getting married, having kids, getting better jobs, and I feel I'm stuck here, in a hole where I can't even see light anymore. Same with family, who I hardly ever see because I don't want to impose. I share an apartment with two others, and feel like such a loser. The more I think about it and the more days go by, killing myself seems more and more like a right thing to do. Although the thought scares me, it gets less and less scary the longer I sit here. The pain is getting worse, and I have nobody to talk to, because I don't want to impose on their lives with my issues. My best friends are doing great, and I don't want to drag them down.. I feel like such a disappointment both to myself and my family, and I don't want this anymore.@@4
37@@ I am so desperate, financially broke, sinking in debts, thinking alone, chased and threatened by the debtors all the time,so lonely and dying slowly. Please don't preach me. Don't give me advises. Don't try to convince me that life worth living when it is like that. Don't give me ""Useful"" links to ""google"" them and search, Don't ask me to listen to this philosopher or that one. What is this life when you are alone? what is the meaning of the good times when you are not sharing it with someone, to laugh together, think together, fight together, plan together, cheer up each other, listen to each other, even argue with each other,give the feeling of safety to each other. To hug and be hugged, to touch and be touched, to watch movies together, to dine out together, to dance on the sweet music together, to share this life until the end, TOGETHER. I want to taste the beauty of life with someone, I want to kiss her cheeks and lips, I want her head on my chest in the night, I want to feel the warmness of the bed and have sweet dreams, I want her to ask me ""why you look upset today?"", I want to hear ""darling you look  great today!"" and I answer her ""thanks honey, I love you"" I LOVE YOU!!!!! HOW I MISS THAT, I didn't say it or hear it since a loooooong time. GOD,Iam tired from talking to myself, even my jokes are not funny when I tell them to ME. GOD, I have too much love, tenderness, care, romance,loyalty,funny jokes,laughs,to give. I know so many romantic places to visit, but waiting for her. GOD, I am waiting for her since a long time. I am there to listen to her, to love her and care for her. Is it too much to ask for? WE CAN SAVE EACH OTHER, and start to live the life that really worth living.@@5
38@@ I don't really feel suicidal but I don't feel much will to live either. I put together a decent life all things considered, but now there's not much driving me forward. After a making as strong an effort to socialize as I ever have before I'm still stuck here today with virtually no friends or romantic life to speak of. I remain distant from my family despite constant vows to get better at that. I started doing things I'd long wanted to do but still feel little enjoyment from anything. I spent a chunk of my life trying to help the less fortunate but now I no longer do this and don't provide anything for anyone. I really tried my best and, for once, I'm willing to let myself accept that my efforts made a difference. But I'm still stuck in this ""place."" I did okay for myself, maybe it's time to cash my chips and call it a life.@@5
39@@ I've known that for years. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I'm a burden on everyone around me. All I'm good for is to be bossed around and poked and prodded and yelled at for the smallest imperfection. Why do I still live? I wish I was never born.@@4
40@@ I know exactly how im going to die i just dont have the balls to do it yet. I wish i wasnt such a coward.@@2
41@@ It's too much for me to bear, never felt so horrible in my life, can't stop crying, can't stop stressing. I trust no one to help, no one ever could. It always ended up with that one sentence ""BE A MAN AND DEAL WITH IT"" or something close. today's my 3rd day without eating/sleeping, i'm losing it and I don't know how long i can last before snapping. Just needed to get this out of my chest...@@2
42@@ Im so low I cant see where up is. I just want to stuff my face till I pass out. I can't stop crying. Everything is too much. And its not getting better. I have no clue what to do. Jobless. School dropout basically but I want to go back so bad, but I cant even afford to eat or go apply for jobs. Im in a stand still and I have no clue what to do. I tried so hard to be optimistic. My phone goes off tomorrow so even if jobs wanted to contact me they can't. I've gained like 30 pounds. Im in so much emotional pain and I just cant.@@3
43@@ It is really hard to live off $160 per month, be 59 yrs old and live w ur mother or be homeless and live in the woods.  I see no light at the end of any tunnel or anywhere, in fact unfortunately I will have to relieve myself of the pressures of daily life since I am not living anyway, merely surviving.  I hate how I have to live, I have been in a huge mess for 14 years, never could see a silver lining and still don't, no support, have read up on easiest suicides and hope I don't mess it up.@@1
44@@ 2 years have officially passed since my bestie died. Visited therapist. 1st one immediately sent me to psychiatrist, coz she thought i was of huge risk for myself. Then psychiatrist told me i wasnt, but put me on Bromazepam. Still didnt buy it. No money. Nor will i, coz i promised a gift to my bestie for 8. March (belated i know). Had a suicide crisis like week ago. bestie managed to talk me out of it. Still i dont know why i allowed her to talk me out, but then i made her promise that next time she wont talk me out. I am alone. I go to uni, but what for? In the end i am just that person that will talk with everyone, try hard around them and try insanely ridiculously hard around my closest friend, yet in the end i am alone. My best male friend doesnt give a shit about me anymore. My bestie is giving up on me, not responding to messages, not sitting with me in theatre anymore... All is crumbling down... My depression also started getting physical manifestations. Before i just had headaches. Now when i feel sad i feel pain in my chest, am going out of breath and my heart is palpitating. My birthday is coming soon. Before it i plan to give a gift to my bestie for 8th of March. I am going so low in mood but i am forced to pretend everything is nice, so i dont damage my friendships no more before i die. I am thinking about killing myself... I almost can feel it.... Oh god, why am i so broken@@3
45@@ I've looked through this forum a bit but I'm not sure I understand its purpose. This is not my point though. I'm not here to help anyone, sorry, but I can't even help myself. I don't want to commit suicide but I'm ready to die. Not sure what to do. Only one reason I have not gone ""home"" yet. My world has fallen apart over the last 7 years. It continues to spiral downward. It would be silly of me to try to type every detail of my life in this post and naive of you to think I could. I'm sad and lonely. I'm ready to live with God.@@4
46@@ I'm not a good person and can never become one. I'm stupid, selfish, lazy, unemployable, unattractive, unlikeable, and undesirable. I alienate people because of my bad personality. I've tried to change it for years and I can't. I have failed miserably at every aspect and endeavor of my life, from the important to the mundane. I'm 25 years old and still live with my parents and living off them financially. I was expelled from college for failing grades. I spent 3 years at college and didn't make it beyond freshman status. I only graduated high school because a couple of teachers felt sorry for me. My grades were the lowest of all my graduating class. All of my cousins and siblings have graduated from top universities. My brother is currently attending grad school at Duke, my sister is getting her masters, my cousin is a Yale graduate, my neice graduated from Vanderbilt, etc. All of my cousins, siblings, and friends are professionals. I am nothing but trash. I have failed. My father is 71 and will not be able to retire because I wasted his savings on college that I failed at. I'm financially dependant so he will never be able to retire. Girls are repulsed by me and alwasy have been. My problems go beyond the standard scope. I'm convinced that I'm a poison, my existence is a poison, and I should therefore just put an end to it. The longer I continue to prolong things and continue to live the longer my life bears negative consequences to the world. There is no need for more chances. I have had hundreds of chances. By continuing to live I am wasting precious time, space, money, and resources that could be used by people who are much worthier. There needs to be societal customs that encourage suicide for people like me. Everything will be better when I'm no longer sickening the world with my existence. Don't think I'm being too hard on myself. Trust me, what I've said here makes my failures look like successes. This is only the tip of the iceburg. I cannot be forgiven or allowed to live any longer. I want to commit suicide. Maybe my suicide will be the only thing I did right. I know when I'm gone everything will be better. We sell ourselves this lie that ""every life is precious"". Nope, not true. My life isn't. My life should be eradicated at all costs. Its just fortunate that I recognize this fact.@@3
47@@ I'm  a newly recovered addict but have went through all of my savings getting clean. Now I live with a friend because I'm homeless (and his mother too)  and am waiting on ssi. i cannot function normally due to mental illness. I feel like I'm drowning and live to sleep. I feel like a burden even though they say I'm not. It's going to be a long wait on ssi and that's if it's given to me.  I dunno what to do to keep busy other than the usual tv and stuff.  Thing is I cannot enjoy relaxing and such because of the extreme guilt I feel. My own mother won't let me stay with her . this is the only place I've found to vent my feelings without alarming anyone but I do feel suicidal on a daily, hourly , even sometimes minute basis. I hope one day to get out of this rock bottom I currently reside in.  What good is my physical health if mentally I'm a mess?@@3
48@@ There is literally no fucking goddamn meaning in this entire fucking universe, absolutely nothing!! Humans gaining intelligence was a fucking mistake, we should have all continued being mindless apes wandering til another comet struck, I'm sick and tired of hearing people say their is some bullshit to live for when the reality of it is their  clearly fucking isn't!! Their is NO benevolent God who cares about you, absolutely not! Instead there are black holes and dark matter, in other words nothingness. Your recently deceased ancestors don't watch over you because they have rotten and they cease to exist. That's it! FUCKING BITCH!!!!!! That's it huh!! That's fucking it!!!!!!!!! IT IS SO FUCKINH RIDICULOUS JUST HOW PATHETIC EVERYTHING IS IT""S FUCKING PATHETIC!! What does one have to live for in this enlightened current year?? I wonder? Is A JOB??? IS IT?? IS IT A RELATIONSHIP??? IS THAT IT??? WHAT THE FUCK IS IT???@@5
49@@ I feel as if I should discuss before I make any final decisions, obviously I'm seriously considering suicide but I don't feel sorry for myself upset or sad, I just haven't experienced anything in life that has had a greater effect on me than the negatives I've gone through. I've split up with my gf of just under 5 years and I guess I was distracted thinking I would just settle for what she wanted. Its over now for good and I'm with somebody else who is a nice person treats me right, has a good job nice house supportive parents, money . She's convinced herself she loves me. But it's not enough to stop me feeling like this. There's honestly nothing more or less she could do. It's not her. I suffer from autism among other things and already feel detached from society, the main problem I feel is that there is literally nothing I really really want. Like when it comes down to it and I'm searching for a goal to work towards I can always think of reasons why it would never work. And the main reason always seems to be its not actually what I want. Yeah sure if I was to have millions I could live a lifestyle where it was possible to constantly distract myself from my true feeling towards earth and humanity. That or alone with my dogs somewhere in the Caribbean with endless weed lol. But neither example is exactly realistic. I've had numerous attempts on my life by others and when it came close to me not making it I was calm and content and ready to leave. I wish that I had of been murderd because I don't like the idea of suicide. If I was too go through with it, it would be in another country so anyone who knew me wasn't aware I was even dead. Funnily enough this seems like the only goal I actually want to work towards. What do you do when genuinely nothing intrests or motivates you in this life?@@4
50@@ Hello! I feel stressed out, exhausted and more. After 2 months i will have exams and my mother is going crazy about it 'couse she thinks i will not finish school. And now i think that too. My marks is medium but i don' t want to study. I don't want to study becouse my entire  school is absolutely rude on me and they think i am idiot. My mom and i.. We are arguing about basic house chores and other stuff and i feel lonely. I don't have energy to do homework and house chores and more. My life now is a mess. And only i can clean it up but i don't want to. I don't have motivation for it. My marks are getting worse and i feel worse too. If i destroy my career i won't have house, car, girlfriend or wife and everything else. I have f***ed my life in only 16 years.. I am 16y old. After suicide i will have peace. At least i think. Well at least i won't be f***ed up. I don't want to hear ""you have so much potential"" or ""don't do it you have so much to live for""  bull sh*tt. I am asking for ways to help myself.@@4
51@@ I don't want to live anymore I can't do it anymore it's too much for me@@2
52@@ Every morning I wake up, wether it's from a bad dream (never a nice one) or my current gf going to work. First it starts with a heaviness on my chest, like something that is pushing me down. My mouth closes up and I can't get any words out. All I can do is think to myself. And then they all start rushing in , memories mixed with fantasy , each scene adds to the physical and emotional pain. My first suicidal thought came when I was around 7/8 . I remember crying in my mothers arms that I wish I was dead. Surely that's not normal for a child. I feel so out of touch with the rest of humanity. It seems to hard to fit in. My family are literally happier without me. My mum suffers from depression as well and it got bad when my brother died. I'll never forget my mum crying , shouting she wished I had of died instead of him. She kicked me out at 14. Sent me to live with my dad. Lol.""dad I was around blokes  aged 50+ working full time or in the pub. These guys weren't succeful. They didn't have wives or children. If they did they were divorced and didn't see their kids anymore. I never had a childhood. Instead I'm sat in my dads house with his tenant 50+ smoking crack cocaine. Why was I exposed to that when I'm already feeling isolated. skip a couple years later and I've been sent to live and kicked out of every willing member of the families home. I'm 21 now and I've been a drug dealer for 5 years. Barely any education. Can I add my dad refused to put me into a school when I lived with him. I don't know where to go or what to do. I literally have no hope. Everything I come into contact with I ruin. It hurts so much inside. I'm not stupid everyday I look for a reason to live. Try and take my mind off things. But it doesn't work. I really don't want to be here at all. I feel I'm incapable of doing anything. I miss my best friend and my nana. I'm not a believer in heaven so I can't take any comfort that id even see them in the after life. I lost the love of my life as well. God she made it so hard to be with at sometimes but I'm aware that so was I. I could of had her back but I fucked it and now it's over for good. I know that she was the one for me. I've never cared about somebody that much before. I've got no future with anyone else because they will never be her. Plus I have nothing to offer anyone. I have no plans no ideas no dreams no real friends no family and at the minute I'm in Â£900 debt. Today I'm placing Â£600 on a 3 team accumulator. If I win I can pay off my debt, as well as having a Â£1000 savings. Then maybe I can start from there and give life another shot. If I loose I'm taking it as the universes way of telling me that's it. I really really don't want people to know its a suicide or to even be found anytime soon. I'd like to just disappear like I never existed . Maybe spread a few rumours around I've come into money and I'm moving abroad so anyone who knew me thinks I'm living it up somewhere. When in reality I'll be cold stiff and alone. That's how I've felt these past 21 years anyways. I really don't think I can take another 24hrs of this but I'll be persistent and wait for fate to intervene it's only one more day in hell I guess.@@2
53@@ Me and my mom got in a fight tonight because I finally opened up to her about some things she's said and done to hurt me in the past. This is not typical behavior for me. I usually keep all my pain to myself 99.999% of the time. But I couldn't take it anymore. There's been tons of things going on for years that I'm just sick and tired of. For starters I complained about her never even meeting my boyfriend. We've been together for 5 years now and she never met him and for the first time I brought it up asking her why she's hasn't met him. She just doesn't want to because he's black and I'm white. That's all. She's never supportive as usual. It should matter more to her that I'm happy instead of focusing on his color. He's certainly not the best guy in the world but most of the time we get along and don't fight a lot and he's not physically or emotionally abusive and he's not a drinker at all. So that's what should matter. Like any couple we got issues like I wish he would like to go out more and he's cheap and little things like this but he could be a lot worse. Anyway this isn't about him. I'm very upset in 5 years she's never met him and doesn't want to. She's never supportive of anything I wear, say, think, do, or anything although of course she denied it. Claims she's supportive, huh. She makes comments what ""losers"" I date yet her men have been just as bad if not worst. At least I've never been physically abused the way she has. She says my dad used to drag her around by her hair and he punched her in the face a few times when they were dating so how is going to criticize the men I've been with. Yes I will admit they were losers and everything but look at her men. The last scumbag she dated was very verbally abusive too and I made a post called ""Despise My Mother's Boyfriend."" I think I even made a couple more about him as well. So where does she get off criticizing the ""losers"" I've dated when she has no room to talk. But the worst part is all the hurtful shit she said about if he's so great then I can move in with him when she dies because otherwise I'll be out in the streets. She always has favored my asshole brother and sister over me and will likely leave them the house we share and also give them the money she has in the bank. I told her, ""this is how you care about me?"" And she said it's her money and she will give it to whoever she wants and this hurt me to the point where I want to die more than ever and I always want to die anyway. But after todays argument my suicide thoughts got a lot worse. I am severely depressed too and she also criticizes me for not having a job. I am disabled and she has zero compassion for me. And my depression is always a 9 or 10 on a scale from 1 to 10 but today it's through the roof to a 100. Tons of other people in the world are on disability too for either a physical or mental illness but I'm always singled out for not having a job even though there are millions of others doing the same thing yet I am sure their families don't criticize and judge them for it the way my so-called family does to me. They put me down for EVERYTHING. I am so fucking sick of it. Then she gave me this speech about, ""oh if it wasn't for me you'd be on the streets."" ""If it wasn't for me you wouldn't be going on trips."" What fucking trips? I am 37 years old and she took me on one fucking trip my entire life. ""If it wasn't for me you wouldn't have a car."" Funny I am the one paying my car bill every month. The only thing she did was give me $2000 for a down payment and I paid her back almost everything I borrowed with the exception of $500 I still owe her. But I paid every bit of that loan back except $500 which I am still working on and that should be paid off in a couple months. And that's another thing. My sister owes her over a $1000 and she won't even pay my mom back and I brought this up to her today too after keeping it inside for so long. Then she says, ""it's my money and I can do whatever I want with it and give it to whoever I want."" Well why the fuck does she complain all the time about how my sister has nerve not paying her that $1000 she owes her back. As a matter of fact yesterday she complained about my sister owing her money and she never makes her pay it back yet if I owed her a fucking nickel she would make good fucking sure I paid the money back yet says nothing to my sister owing her money. Then I told her she should be happy for me that I have a boyfriend because if I didn't I'd be super alienated and isolated which I still basically am anyway. And she said it's my own fault for being alienated and isolated and that also crushed me. I asked her how it's my fault and she says like every time my sister or brother or niece comes over I go in my bedroom and hide. Well to that I replied none of them want me around anyway. I mean they know where my bedroom is and they never bother to knock on my door or say hi or anything. I'm only giving them what they want by hiding out in my room when they come over. They have family get togethers and they never invite me either. Like this Easter they are going out without me as usual. And the things I am writing are just the tip of the iceberg. This story is so much more complicated than this. My mother points out my shortcomings but never ever points out my brother and sisters shortcomings. It's as if they can do no wrong in her eyes. My asshole brother was super abusive emotionally to me most of my life calling me hurtful names as a young woman like loser, whore, stupid, fat, and the list goes on and on yet she never even defended me. That makes her just as guilty as he is. What mother allows one sibling to abuse another that way and does nothing about it? She encourages it if anything. He's a father and didn't even want to pay child support for his fucking kid and he has a good paying job that makes $30 an hour. If it wasn't for the state and the girl taking him to court for that money I bet anything he wouldn't have paid that girl a dime in child support. He's also not a part of the kids life in anyway shape or form like being around and spending time with the kid and so forth. He's also been in jail before and she won't tell me why. When@@3
54@@ I have spent my whole life (nearly 27 years) trying to find stability and happiness. I've been through way to much and I've lost all my faith in a decent future for myself. I'm ready to give up. I can't take it anymore.@@4
55@@ I've been replying to few posts about suicide on this forum, trying to say that there is another option to suicide - living life differently. Perhaps most people would reply to this: ""I wanna die because it is too hard to live dumbass"". I hear you. I would never thought before that I can be that depressed. On the weekend I had a major breakdown. I was crying like crazy thinking to kill myself so I can never wake up. It is hard to live sometimes and suicide seems like an alternative. It's been few days after my breakdown. I've read and call a friend, and I seriously considered signing up myself into the mental health hospital for a few days. Then I thought about the book I keep rereading over and over again. It called This Is How by Augusten Burroughs. I love it. One of my favourite part is when author is talking about suicide: ""Do you know the phrase printed on those fire extinguishers bolted to the wall and locked inside a glass box? The one at every school and in every building downtown? In case of emergency, break glass. When your life reaches the state of emergency and the only thing you can think of is to end it, maybe the thing to do is to break it. Walk out the door. You can leave. You can open the front door, step outside, and make a right or left. And keep going. Maybe this new life will be worse. Maybe this new life will be better. Some people can only live if they start over and make a brand new life, one they make themselves, entirely from scratch."" And then I said FUCK IT. If I am sitting at home and ready to kill myself, I need to ""break the glass"" and get the fuck out of this situation as far and as soon as possible. I never saw the whales in real life, but I always wanted to. How fucking amazing this can possibly be: ??! I mean, since I am already at the point of thinking about suicide, I can as well just take a risk and do whatever the fuck I want with my life. that's another dream of mine: . But I always planned to finish school, find a better job, then find a better place to live, then buy a car and possibly get married... blah blah... But now I am thinking that I am not sure how far my depression and suicidal thought can take me, so I might as well just start ticking off the things from my bucket list right now. I am out, gonna need to finish writing the list of things I should have to travel (never done it before, need to do some research). Hope it'll change someone else's mind..@@5
56@@ So I'm 25 from the UK, I don't know what to say or what I'm doing really.... Just going with my gut instinct that hoping by writing on this people can help... I don't feel like I have anyone too turn too.... Please don't judge me I feel alone, even with people around me... I feel like I'm in a box and that my life is constantly two steps forward and one step back... Nothing seems too go right without something else going wrong too make it all seem pointless, my girlfriend has just left me, my friends/flat mates are moving out, I have no money, I stack shelves for a living where nobody will talk too me, no ambition, no goals, nothing too look forward to or get excited about, all I see is right now until the day I die, except I hate my life! I'm too paranoid too leave the house unless it's going too work or going too the shop, everyone is so happy around me and there life's going great, I've got money problems up my back, an ex girlfriend who's broke my heart and that sense of constant unhappiness and disappointment. The other day I tried to kill myself, turns out I found out after that it last really hard to actually die off it, so instead I had server heart pains and gut aches... I dream on a night time about the worst things and when I lie in bed all I can think about is how I'm going too kill myself, my google history is full of different painless ways too die.... This is kind of my last reach out for someone too help me....@@1
57@@ So a little while ago I posted a thread here about depression and got a lot of really nice responces, but I don't know if I can keep doing this anymore. I tried to break out of my shell a little bit more and at first it was alright. I became friends with more people and was happy for the first time in a little bit. Then after about a week all the friends that I made started ignoring me. They still are, I even tried to talk to somebody this mourning and they gave me the silent treatment for the billionth time. I don't think anyone appreciates my existence anymore and I think I'm just about done.@@4
58@@ Please someone.. Help me.. I cant do this anymore.. I ruin every good relationship that I have because of my immaturity and temper.. My boyfriend for more than a year broke up with me last week.. It was a hard time for us february.. He has a big problem in his business, and I decided to tell his parents about it since he was becoming suicidal.. And I know that his parents are the only ones who could help him.. So they were trying to solve the problem.. Everything was going well.. But on valentines and our 1st anniversary, we didnt get to celebrate any because it so happens that he has meetings regarding that business during those days.. No flowers no nothing.. He said if he give me flowers itll just die waste of money so why not we just eat somewhere nice.. We didnt get to celebrate.. Then on my birthday he has a meeting again but this time he made time to go out with me have lunch and watch a movie.. He kept telling me he's gonna make up for it when things are better.. But I cant help but be sad.. So last week, we were supposed to meet but then we rescheduled until we werent able to go out.. The last rescheduling happened when I insisted that we meet near my office which is near his house too because I wont be able to go home early and I dont want to keep him waiting.. Because he has a meeting near my house.. But he insisted that he wait for me to go home because he doesnt want me to drive home late.. But I insisted that I'm with my mom so its okay.. But he still insisted.. So I said to resched.. But we ended up not going out anymore for that week.. Then on saturday he meets up with his friends.. And I got angry.. I told him all the negative feelings that ive been feeling.. I was mean.. And I even told him that we should take time to cool off, time apart.. Then eventually I said we should break up.. The next day I took it back, but he didnt want me anymore.. He broke up with me.. Until now we're still broken up and its driving me crazy.. I cant do this anymore.. We met up awhile ago.. Just as friends.. But I cant take it I cant accept it.. Please someone talk to me please.. I love him so much and I cant live without him.. I drank cold medicine because I want to sleep.. But all this anxiety is keeping me from sleeping.. I know I'm not perfect.. But shouldnt he accept me for who i am both good and bad if he truly loves me?? Because I accept him as he is.. When he gets angry I dont break up with him.. I want to kill myself!! It hurts so bad.. I dont know if we're getting back together.. If there is still a chance for us.. I want to die.. Please..@@2
59@@ I've been questioning for a while whether life is trying to tell me that I was never meant to be and it's time for me to go. It certainly seems like it. I'm 24 and so far I've done NOTHING in my life. Never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl, don't even have a driver's license... And every damn job I try they're always dissatisfied. Not because I'm a bad person or because I'm not working as I'm supposed to, but because I'm ""slow"" and I don't know what else goes on in their mind. I'm short in stature and lack confidence, so maybe that's why they're not liking me. I've just started working in a pizza parlor, and I'm beginning to suspect the owner isn't satisfied with me. I don't want to fail at yet another job. I mean if I cannot work (because nobody wants to employ me), and if I can't get a girlfriend (because women don't like me), and I can't do nothing... Then why live? It almost seems as if life has been truly telling me I don't belong here, and when I refused to listen it's now literally pushing me to just leave. If I get fired from yet another job, or quit due to overwhelming criticism, then I'm not sure how longer I'll be able to take it.@@4
60@@ It just isn't.@@5
61@@ I am not doing well at all today or for any day that is. The days are getting unbearable. Just surfing the internet makes me irritable. I just want to permanently sleep and we all know what that means. No one seems to understand how bad I am and no one seems to understand or want to help me. Doctors are pretty incompetent not putting referrals in correctly which further impedes searching for answers. I feel like I am getting close to suicide every day. I do not even want to explain why I am suicidal right now. It makes sense to me. I really hate life and what it does not offer me. I am not functioning and there is no hope in sight. I am not even functioning on a basic level.@@3
62@@ I've been stewing in my own depression and suicidal haze for years and years now. I joined this site, never got around to writing the intro...just knowing there was an outlet that if I need reinforcement that I can make it through this, I thought I might find it here. I don't remember what I like anymore. I don't really know who I am. Very few things make me truly happy. For the longest time things have been dark, dark, dark. I had a plan, several, to end it. But there were people to take care of that are okay on their own without me now. No one needed me anymore. So I set a time period, gave myself time to really think about it, and for a while there I was just waiting for the day to strike me. Someone came into my life who gave me just enough hope to carry on for a while. And for the first time in a long long time I feel like maybe I should be brave and strong again. I need help, I really do. And I'm reaching out because I don't know what or how. My job pretty much prohibits me from showing any sign of mental incapacity. I need to fix this quietly, just as I have suffered. What do I do. How do I find a way to help end this suffering while not ending myself?@@4
63@@ Hi everyone. My story is very complex. I am a 32 year old  female who became sick when i was 29. Before then i was a happy person but suffered mild anxiety and sleep problems but was never suicidal like i am now. For 6 months when i was 28 i was having trouble getting to sleep and i was working full time and needed help so i was prescribed the medication stillnox. Before my 29th birthday i had an awful turn from the medication and became psychotic, delusional and suicidal. In the last 3 years i have been admitted to the psych wards 13 times my longest stay was 6 months. It has been horrific, im still in the same state as i was 3 years ago when i became ill. I have tried every medication that is out there antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers everything! My brain has been permanently altered and i dont know what to do my suicidal thoughts are 24/7, i cant function, my mind is jumbled half the time when i speak i feel like i dont make any sense, my memory is severely affected. I cant work, drive and have lost all my friends. I dont see the point in going on. Even the psychiatrists have said they cannot help me and my prognosis is bad. What on earth do i do? Im still on some medication im thinking about coming off all of it to see if my brain will ever heal but i dont think it will. Ive even had professionals say that suicide is an option for me, im crying whilst im writing this. Would there be anywhere that could help me? Please any comments would be appreciated.@@2
64@@ I just can't... I can't fight again just for the sake of fighting... hate deosn't drive me enough to keep living... I can't live aggain without goals for future... without hope that it will ever get better... I just can't... I was given a taste of what it means to have hope, of what it means to be happy, and then it was taken away from me... it's ok though... I don't deserve it... Maybe I'm hearthless bastard, but I feel sorry for people who suffer... because I know what it feels like@@4
65@@ I don't know if anyone who knows my story still is still around. Basically my circumstance circulates my controlling parent and a job they've forced me into doing. I've held on for so long but I think the time has finally come to a point where I can no longer deal with it anymore. I don't want to let go of my friends but my suffer won't end, I have no way to continuing any longer. Once upon a time I had hopes and dreams, but now it's all over.@@3
66@@ I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts for ten years now. Sometimes it's easy to dismiss them, other times it is more difficult. I went through a very rough period in 2011 that I would consider one of my all time lows - I was living in a new country with no friends nearby, a friend of mine had committed suicide earlier in the year and a few other people in my life had died recently. It was rough but I got through it and moved on. Last summer my closest friend told me in no uncertain terms that we are not friends and he wants nothing to do with me. Since then I have distanced myself from all of my friends. I found it hard to believe people really cared about me when the one person I was closest to obviously did not, and I just generally found it difficult to talk to people around the time. I tried over the next few months to push myself to talk to people to some degree and to meet up every once in a while, but then just before Christmas a 14-year-old girl I know was killed in a freak accident and it really set me back. Since then, several other people I know have died, and I've been trying to push through it but feeling more hopeless about life than ever, and with no-one to talk about it with since my closest friend is no longer in my life. Last week, a girl I was very close with in school killed herself, on my birthday. And I am struggling to put one foot in front of the other. I think at the moment the one thing keeping me from just offing myself is knowing that I might make someone else feel the way I've been feeling since her death, and I don't want to be a part of some horrible chain reaction or domino effect. I'm just having a rough time right now, and it's not something I feel like I can talk about with anyone. I don't feel like I have anyone I can talk to. I don't have friends I would feel in any way comfortable breaking down in front of, I don't have any kind of support system right now. And it is tough.@@3
67@@ I can't believe that I am here again. I am again considering it. It would be much easier for everybody if I was not here. All of my friends left me. My parents hate me. Life would be much more simpler if I was not here. It's just an endless cycle. After this I become happy then sad then here. But I don't think I will become happy again. No. I know I won't.@@2
68@@ I don't even know why I joined this, because I don't want ""help"". Most things that help other people don't help me. And the thing I hate most is this ""depression"" isn't in my head, it's in my life. It's like every time I manage to climb out of a hole and get some footing I'm kicked back in. I'm 27 and I've lost just about everyone and everything important to me. Friends, relatives, pets, girlfriends, abilities, opportunities. I've lost them to death, distance, break ups, and me just losing myself because of all the pain I've gone through losing everyone I love. I used to be so strong and vibrant and full of life, ready to take on the world. I'd take care of some of the most abused people you could imagine, helping them mature and protect themselves, give up self-harm, drugs, and other bad behaviors. I was able to save so many lives, help people who had be told they couldn't be helped. I've spent my life helping people and animals who no one cared about. Not for anything, just because it was right and I wanted to. I started getting anxiety after I finished one year of college and two of my 3 best friends of 4-5 years basically told me they did not want to be friends with my anymore. I got a Bachelor's degree in social work, wanted to have a therapeutic group home for traumatized teenage girls. But then crises happened with the girl I more or less adopted as my daughter, and just as I was recovering from that my best friend killed herself. I had already been accepted to graduate school so I dragged myself through that, and in my last semester my parents' marriage broke up in violence and we had to throw my father out for becoming abusive (he had never been such when I was a child, he devolved into depression and alcoholism after he retired when I was 17). Literally in the same week my close friend called me in tears to tell me her almost 4 year old daughter, who was like my niece, died suddenly. I managed to help myself through that by the fact I'd recently come out of the closet and then found myself a girlfriend. However she was severely mentally ill with bulimia, self-harm, PTSD, and much to my horror I discovered over a year later, DID. Not to mention it was a long distance relationship over country lines, which is a huge pain in the ass. I was with her for two years and left her for another girl I found closer to home, also because I couldn't deal with the multiple personalities anymore. I lost my daughter through an extremely complicated and painful process that I am partially guilty for, and that's not just bad feelings talking. I literally am responsible. Then I had another relationship that lasted a year, and she was also mentally ill (though less so) and had a mother spawned from hell that hated me, treated her like a child and made my life miserable. Through all of this I was jobless. I spent over 3 years desperately searching for a job in social work. No one ever gave me a chance. I applied to over 200 jobs and most didn't even have the decency to give me a rejection letter. I finally ended my relationship with the other girl and decided to try and scrap social work. After all, my mind and emotions were falling apart so I was unable to take care of myself, nonetheless anyone else. So I went back to my first passion of animals and got a dog training certification. Much to my shock and delight, in a span of about 3 weeks this past summer, I got hired at an animal shelter (the sort of job I wanted most), and I met a fantastic girl. She was smart, sweet, successful, had loads in common with me, and she was mentally healthy. I was so happy...for three months I had a wonderful girlfriend and a job I loved with room to grow in a large animal organization. It was hard work and didn't pay much and had a really crappy commute, but I really loved the job and felt like I was making a difference. I finally started to feel good about myself, like my life was finally moving. I was even starting to forgive myself more for mistakes I made, which is a huge problem I have. Then in November I was hit a crushing blow. My supervisors said that though I worked hard and knew a lot, I just wasn't good enough at handling the dogs. I'm too clumsy and slow and just...stupid. I think I have dyspraxia, but I don't have the money to get a formal diagnosis. And even if I did it's not something you can ""cure"". But either way, they told me the would give me another chance with a month on probation, and if I proved myself then I could keep my job. I failed. I tried SO fucking hard and I failed. If anything I messed up more. But I tried so hard... I was fired 5 days before Christmas, 2 days after my birthday. I really wanted to kill myself. I think the only reason I didn't was that I didn't want to ruin everyone's Christmas, especially because two of my friends were specifically coming to visit me. Now I'm regretting that choice, because I wouldn't have had to live through the past two months. I had some major melt downs after it happened, and I hate putting my poor mom through it. My crying and screaming at the top of my lungs like a beast ripping through my body. I just can't stop. It's awful. And I scare my dogs. I've handled losing my job well for how I was feeling at the time...but my girlfriend and a hope for a future with her kept me going. And how I didn't want to hurt my mom. I even got a small part time pet sitting job to try and get some money while I look for another real job. I've been applying and even going on some interviews. But with everything that's happened to me I've been more sensitive and more like to cry at little things. I'm not manipulative or anything. If anything sometimes I try to hold my reactions in and not make my sadness or anxiety overpower out relationship. But apparently it was too much. And last night she broke up with me because I was making her feel ""overtaxed."" I just couldn't manage and left, I couldnt deal with hearing about how I'm not wanted. So now I'm broken, jobless, with no really close friends that live in my state, just living with my mother and feeling like a child. I've lost so much and I don't even feel like me anymore. I feel empty. I tried therapy multiple times and all it was was rumination, and with how much I've studied therapies it feels like playing a video game with the cheat book. I'm extremely difficult and usually just get angry when people try to help because I feel patronized. Most things that comfort others don't comfort me. I just wish there was someone or something that could help me but there isn't. I just want someone to tell me I can have a good job I can work at and a woman in my life that truly loves me and wants to spend her life with me. And it's not like I haven't worked for it... But I just feel like now I won't ever be able to get anything I worked for. I can't fight anymore. I just can't deal with it. I have nothing else going for me anymore. Right now the best I can hope for is that I'll get a job I interviewed for and that will make me normal enough for my girlfriend to take me back. Otherwise I'm just hoping I die in an accident. And please don't anyone tell me how accomplished I am or that I'm a good person. I know I am, but it doesn't do me any damned good. I've got a great track record of saved human and animal lives, as well as a lot of expensive pieces of paper that prove I know things. But what do I actually have to show for it? Nothing. Being reminded of ""What I have"" in that sense just makes me feel worse.@@3
69@@ I'm a 23 year old male living with a room mate in a bad neighborhood. When I was 17 my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer, so I dropped out of school to take care of her because my father had to work and my sister couldn't handle the stress. She passed when I was 18 and it tore me up. I already had a drinking and drugging problem and it got much worse once she passed. I was extremely depressed and self medicated 24/7 but never officially attempted suicide. I got sober and life was good for a little while. I stayed sober for a year, got a good paying job that seemed like it might become a career and found a lovely woman to be my companion. When I turned 22 i noticed my fathers health declining. He never got over the passing of my mother and became to drink more and more. He was eventually laid off at work and ended up selling his house. A few months after all that happpened he died due to liver and kidney failure, it was very quick and abrupt. I took time off work to surround myself with the good friends and family friends that I had (i don't have much family besides immediate. I started drinking and drugging heavily again, but this time it was different. It wasn't as bad as before but it hurts more. I ended up quitting my job because I started having intense anxiety and panic attacks, I ended up in a psyche ward for a suicide attempt, i broke up with my girlfriend because I felt that I was becoming a burden in her life, she's never dealt with stuff like this and didn't understand, my depression was talking a very heavy toll on her and we agreed to split up. Now I sit in my room, alone most times for days on end trying to avoid contact with the outside world besides social media wondering how the fuck I'm going to fix this and stop feeling like I want to end my life and be done with all of it. The anxiety, the pain, the unanswered questions, the regret, the doubt that I'll ever make it past the darkest moment in my short life thus far. I'm terrified to love, or to let anyone into my life or even go to the liquor to get one more 6 pack. I'm ashamed of who I have become and I want out. I want to turn off the lights go to sleep and never wake up again.@@4
70@@ I am living a life in hell. Every moment of my life is filled with agony. The worst part is that my mother has to witness seeing me living a life of agony. She cries a lot. She has trouble falling asleep at night. I fucking dont know what to do. I think it would end the suffering of me and my mother when I am dead. My mother is 63 and she has ruined her health. I can't see her in this condition. She had better be dead. I want her dead. It is better than witnessing a life of misery. Same with me. I had better be dead. What are your thoughts on this?@@2
71@@ Ironically the past few weeks my life has gotten a lot easier. A few months ago I was at all time lows, hoping that I'd get hit by a car or that I'd somehow have a fatal disease and even began planning my own death. I thought about it everyday nonstop. Don't get me wrong I still do think about it every day. I do have a little more control over my thoughts than before. My health has gotten better, my relationships with friends and family has gotten better, sure money is an issue and always has been but life isn't perfect, but I still can't get the urge and all the thoughts of depression, loneliness, suicide, out of my head. I still feel no real connection with anyone or anything. I'm still relying on people and I don't want to be a burden on people. I want to leave them all with good graces and leave this life and see what the after life has for me. But there's no way to ""kill yourself on accident"". I don't want people to be miserable because of me. But I feel that I've had enough of this world and my time could be better spent elsewhere and not as someone who relies on other people and needs support. I've tried my hardest to make it on my own, to stand on my own two feet and take care of myself.....but I can't. It's impossible. I just want to be able to feel happiness and yet the only emotion I've ever been able to trust feel is sadness. I can't live like that not forever. I know one day I will go through with my own death. It's just hard to talk to anyone anymore. I just want to be alone. Misery may love company but not me, no one needs to suffer with me.@@3
72@@ I'm out of work.  I'm 47.  I have nothing to look forward to.  I have chronic fatigue due to sleeping issues that have not responded well to treatments.  For the rest of this miserable life I will have to struggle with fatigue every damn day. Unless I get the stones to kill myself.@@4
73@@ Hi, as all of you probably know, I suffer from severe depression, this came on at a very young age. I'm struggling bad atm and honestly I'm playing my life day by day like a survival game. It's beggining to hurt when I'm thinking and everything's got me feeling so low I begin to think suicide is the only way out. I've been fighting these thoughts for about 2 - 3 years , although struggling with depression for about 7 years ( from 10 years old) . I'm begginging to freak out and have manic episodes, for example, seeing creepy faces and scary stuff when I'm trying to go to sleep, hearing my name being called out when listening to music when there is nobody about and shadows in mirrors and the corner of my eye. I know this stuff isn't real/ there but it is still worrying, I'm wondering if this could be because of me fighting severe anxiety , depression and suicidal thoughts or if this might be something completely different like schitzophrenia in development? Any advice is much appreciated thanks. I currently go without medication because when I went in with depression the doctor simply told me 'no pain, no gain' and no medication etc as other doctors don't want to put me on tablets. I don't do counselling as I usually get wound up by the pressure and rebel against their decisions. God I'm so self destructive!@@4
74@@ I don't want to live anymore, I am inferior to all of you, you are all better than me.@@2
75@@ Met her when she was 12. Married at 17. 2 years later came kids. At 11 years was her affair, my forgiveness and reconciliation. At 16 years of marriage she filed for divorce. She hid it well. Never saw it coming. It's been 2 years. She's remarried. I'm alone. Well the kids live with me. She left. Abandoned us all. Left the job I loved to have one that provided financially for the family. Can't pay bills now. Have no spare time for another job. Feel guilty every time I see my kids. I couldn't keep a family together for them. I unequivocally love her. My heart is dead. I'm heavily medicated. That sucks. Oldest wants to go live with her. She lets him drink smoke and anything else he wants at 15. I think he hates or resents me. What's good in life? Nothing. Don't even care for bacon anymore. Have not eaten in just over 2 weeks now. Sleep is messed up due to the medication. No drive to take care of myself. I want to roll back the clock or live with Jesus. I miss her too much to explain. I want my old life. I've given the broad strokes. Left out some details. I'm ready. Does anyone have a magic word?@@5
76@@ Wish I had some support. I am undergoing therapy right now. Tried to kill myself, so that I could die in bliss. Didn't have the courage to even do that. Felt soo much anguish that very moment. Not one person is there to care for me. My death is extremely insignificant. I think I will go into psychiatric ward, I am the biggest loser. The least I could do is live with being a loser.@@4
77@@ I hate my life. No one ever gave a fuck about me. I will never be loved or cared about by anyone. I wish I wasn't born. My life is hopeless. I have no future.@@4
78@@ I very much want death. After much evaluation of my life (and life in general), there is no question that everything points to the conclusion that I must end my life. The sooner, the better. I'll unpack it: I have spent my whole life walking and living in darkness. Everything I've ever done has been futile and has failed. I have lived with quirks and differences that are irreconcilable with the surrounding world and with life. I have tried to overcome them for so long but things never improve. There are lyrics from two different songs that describe me perfrctly. The first one is by the band Extreme. It's called ""Am I ever Gonna Change"". It talks about someone who is ashamed of who he is, who can't stand how he has lived his life, and wants so desperately to change but can never seem to make it happen. It has a line in it that says ""Am I ever gonna change? Will I always stay the same? If I say one thing and I do the other, same old song goes on forever"". The other song is by the band Iron Maiden. It is called ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"". It has a line in it that goes, ""you're over half-way there but the miles, they never seem to end, as if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere. It seems so futile. Run on and on. Run on and on"". It is about perseverance and trying to beat insurmountable odds. But it depicts someone who struggles with the thoughts of how overwhelming life is and how it often seems you are running and running and never getting anywhere. My life is that way and this song says it perfectly. Try as I might to improve or make life livable, the only thing that comes of my life is failure and more failure. I can't even carry on a simple conversation. People easily pick up on my quirks and always treat me differently. I notice it, no matter how subtle it is. Everyone around me at least makes progress in their own lives. They all at least have college degrees and jobs. I have nothing. I'm a 25 year OLD MAN and I have nothing to show for myself. I live with my parents and have no job. My job history is very botched and atrocious. I am unemployable. I have attempted college several times and either quit or got expelled for bad grades. I currently attend a community college which I just enrolled in This semester. But I don't see me getting through this one either. The end is just so far away and I can't hold on or handle the work. Everyone else in my life went straight through school no problem, no holdups. They all have good jobs and are financially independant. I won't even go into the specifics of my problems because they are so complex that they cannot be discussed. I know that life is not for me. I have kept trying for too long, when everything in my life is telling me ad nauseam that I need to put myself out. I think when undesirables like me commit suicide, it makes way for more desirable people to take the place, use the resources, and occupy the space. It is a much less wasteful use of resources. I am a vermin and am deserving of extermination. Now, I know the people here are going to argue with me over my depiction of myself. You will probably tell me none of this I've said about myself is true and that I can get better. Well, none of you have lived my life. I live with myself every day and I know what happens in my life. The story never gets better. It never develops into something positive or worth while. I know this because it has been my entire existence for 25 years. So don't dare fucking tell me I'm wrong. I know everything I've said here to be fact. It is plain for all to see.@@4

I just want everyone to know that i am sorry for everything that i have done that has ever caused hurt or pain. I've never meant to hurt anyone that has shown any sort of care or love for me. I have ruined everything that comes my way for a reason i don't know. I am just a fucking mess and a total fuck up. This isn't a message/writing or whatever about self pity or loathing... it's just me wanting the whole world to know how sorry i am for anything i have done. I am far from perfect, i wish so much i could go back in time and fix all the problems and mistakes i have made. The pain, guilt and memories haunt me so much everyday. I can't rest, i can't sleep, i can't be happy knowing and thinking i am a bad person for all the wrongs i have done. Some people can go through life and not give a single fuck about a thing, i wish i could be one of those people but i am not. Every little thing bothers me and i feel constantly guilty and to blame for everything, even things that have nothing to do with me. I have lost so many people who have said they 'loved' me. I pushed them away or I have been taken for granted and made a fool of so many times... and i am starting to think i deserve it. Is that why i am the way i am? I don't ask for much from anyone but all i wish is for not to feel this way. I want to so much disappear from this place and be out of everyones life. I think to myself that it would be better for everyone if i died or disappeared... that way i couldn't cause any more pain to people who come into my life. I don't know what to do anymore... i have a family who care for me and love me and would do anything for me but they have no idea of how fucked up i am in my head. They know i am a bit of a mess but not to the extent that i wake up everyday with regret that i am still alive!? I can't say the word 'sorry' enough... it has lost it's meaning because i don't know what else to say. I am just so sorry for every single thing i have done wrong. I am sorry for hurting people, especially when it's not been intentional. I just want forgiveness of some sort... even though i know it won't be enough to stop me feeling the way i do. Someone from my past has got back into my life recently... i hurt them emotionally with my ways, i basically disappeared out of their life without a goodbye or an explanation. Long story short, we are great together again and it was like nothing has changed as they understood why i went away... but it's always in my head that i hurt them, and that kills me inside. The thought of knowing i made them cry, made them feel like they were nothing... knowing i let them down. I should feel better that they have forgiven me... but i don't. I don't feel like i deserve to be forgiven. I don't even make any sense because i am contradicting myself i want forgiveness but i can't even accept it when it comes my way. I have changed as a person again the last few months... going back to my old ways... going out all the time, getting drunk, making stupid fucking decisions and waking up next to people i shouldn't. For the longest time i thought i wouldn't be like that again... but i guess i am in self destruct mode. I shouldn't be feeling so bad though when all i want to do is not care.. I thought those ways were behind me but i have fallen into the cycle of destruction again. My best friend knows i am like this and they are the last person i want to hurt... though i know in some way i have. If they ever read this i want you to know you are my best friend and i love you so much and thank you for being in my life and putting up with my shit... and i don't regret anything we have been through. I wish things could be so different... i wish i could be different. To my family, to my best friend... and to all those that have been hurt in some way by my actions... i am truly sorry, i am so fucking sorry x@@5
85@@ The torment is so much, the pain, the hatred, I react to it by abusing drugs and self harming, but I don't have many drugs available and I think harming myself on an ongoing basis is like slow suicide. The worthlessness that I feel, the piece of shit that I feel, the most disgusting lowest scum, I just feel the only way to end this is to end my life. I don't want to and can't go on like this anymore, the mockery, the abuse, being treated like garbage, made fun by everyone, laughed at by everyone, hated by everyone. I feel it is time to go.@@2
86@@ I dont know if i ever put my whole story down....begining to end.  the best i can do is summarize as there is alot of pain i do not wish to relive.  My life changed one day at the age of 27...I now 41.  I was at the cusp of full independence within arms reach of seizing almost everything major I wanted to get out of life. I was 3/4 through my internship, was talking to another intern who was pretty cool and quite beautiful, there seemed to be mutual interest.  Then within a month and a half everything was taken from me.  The handyman job that supported me through college went out of business and now the internship which offered me a job was my last hope. (i was an unpaid intern with a month left to go). A position was being created for me in the new sales division after my performance in several key assignments and the steady course of the semester.  But some asshole had to become jealous.  Instead they felt entitled to the position and proceeded to sabotage me and make the work environment hostile towards me.  He got into both private and work email addresses, erased business messages, switched office supplies so I assembled the mailers incorrectly, turned the small office against me saying i was making more than them.  there's more but it's too hurtful to go into Long story short i had a meltdown......i was so stressed i was eating right, sleeping right, couldn't take care of myself well and did things like come to work late inspite of trying to fight back against him.  He would talk about me in round about tones that it made me paranoid.  Would do things to taunt me.  Eventually I would get a pyschotic break.  I could literally feel something in my brain like a myelene sheathe rip or something...(i know there is no myelene sheath in the brain).  This would lead to me losing the internship, my mind, my apartment, my future, my love interest and all of my savings.@@5
87@@ I was once diagnosed with chronic depression and severe anxiety. Tried to kill myself 13 times. I have absolutely zero friends. My mother was worried for me, so she took me to many therapists, none of whom were able to help me. Instead, they just listened and pretended to care. Stopped wasting my money. It was then that I realized that nobody in this world gives a damn about you. To them, you only matter if you are useful, otherwise you're ignored. It's the harsh reality. I also realized that I could solve my own problems or I could live and suffer till i die. My issues are unsolvable so I'd rather suffer instead. I'm still alive, had enough of this agony and pain. Nothings changed after 25 years, after all the therapists. People walk over me everyday, like I am some ant. My life is as insignificant as an ant.@@2
88@@ I feel so crap all the time and i just want to die. I have absolutely no self confidence, no self esteem and no friends. I do have a wife, two step daughters ( one lives with her nan) and a daughter. We also have two of our own dogs, two foster dogs, three cats and sometimes can have a holiday dog with us. I currently could not harm myself in the same way i could never harm another living thing, but i spend all my time fantasising about dying. This could be as a victim of a random attack or being in a freak accident, the list goes on. I really have had enough of this world and everything in it and wish i had the courage to just get on with leaving this place. I have suffered from depression for the last twenty years and have been using weed to bury my head in the sand for the last eighteen years, so that i could give the perception that everything was fine and avoid ever having to deal with my problems because it felt that nobody cared anyway, so why bother? The way i met my wife is another story, but when we met, we both knew that we both had problems. Unfortunately, i used my wife's problems as a way of avoiding dealing with mine and now that my wife has dealt with most her problems, I've been left behind. Some of you who may read this might be thinking, ""surely your wife and kids want to help you?"". Well, rest assured, it feels that they really don't give a sh*t about me, (apart from my daughter, who is too young to understand) and they all have no interest in trying to make me feel better in any way. I love them all to bits, but due to my depression and living with me for the last nine years, it is at a point where i have to front and pretend everything is fine to them, as they can not cope with my depressive state any longer and it fees like they no longer love me back in any way. I broke down to them all a few weeks back and explained sevaral of my problems and that i need help from them with many things and not one of them has done a thing for me since to try and cheer me up, or ty to help me feel better in any way. Before you ask, yes this does include my ""wife I would leave them, but currently my mental state won't let me and i just don't have the courage to leave either. When my wife told me that i either needed to sort myself out or leave, i did go to the docs and have been for an initial counseling consultation, but i had so much to tell the counselor that it felt i wasn't able to give a clearer enough picture of my problems in the time available and the counselor told me that it would be eight weeks before i hear anything else from anyone! This left me feeling like just a number, a statistic and I left feeling just as bad if not worse than before i went. Especially after dealing with the anxiety in the build up to the appointment. Since the appointment absolutely nothing has changed, other than the fact i am fronting again to try and hide my depressive state to my ""loved ones"". It does feel like my wife no longer wants me in any way, other than someone to do everything for her. Sometimes I wonder if I have already died and I'm in hell, with no escape!@@5
89@@ Today has got to be one of the worst days of my life. We are losing our home. I've been out of work for almost a year. Unemployment ran out in January and I can't get any kind of assistance from the state because we don't have children. That rubs more salt into the wound because we want them but I have had several miscarriages. I've been looking for work and had finally landed what was going to be a great job. It had great pay, benefits, hours everything I was looking for. It was going to save us. Then 2 days before my start date, I get a call saying they rescinded their offer because my credit was too bad. I wanted to curl up in a ball and die. The only work I can get with shitty credit is call center work and my personality does not mesh well with it at all. It stresses me out to the point of inducing seizures, causing me to miss work and eventually unemployed again. But even the call centers I've applied to won't hire me. My fiancÃ© is a self employed photographer but his income isn't very consistent and not nearly enough to live on. I've always been primary breadwinner but I just can't get anyone to hire me. I want to file for bankruptcy but I can't afford it, we can't even afford food. We both have/had major chronic illnesses that require medicine and appointments that we can't afford. And that's on top of dealing with everyone's comments and opinions about my depression, not being married and not having children ( I am literally the ONLY one without kids in my family). Finding out we are losing the house is the final straw. I can't take it anymore. The only two bright spots were my cat and dog who are like my own children. But the pain is just too much. I tried so hard over the years to try to keep us going and to someday get ahead and I failed spectacularly. I feel so worthless. I feel like people think I wasn't trying that I was just sponging off of whoever offered to help over the years. I worked jobs I hated and went back to school to try to get ahead. Nothing. In fact I'm worse off than when I first started. I've always been an unlucky person but the last year feels like the god/ universe whoever or whatever is out to get me. Everything that can go wrong has gone wrong. I just want to end it. I'm tired of fighting a battle I can't win. I'm tired of being the one everyone looks down on for being unfortunate. I'm tired of always doing the right thing and being equated to being no better than a murderer. I no longer wish to be here and I have nothing left to lose. Every night I go to sleep, I hope I don't wake up. I want to die, I don't know what else I can do?@@3
90@@ Hey! I am in extreme condition. I don't know what to do. First of all. My classmates said to go kill myself.. They say it all the time but first time.. EVER! They all said it. Everyone in room (there weren't teacher in room) i am disappointed about life. I don't think I deserve death. Second i got in another argue with mom and brother Third. I got spit on again. And many more. I have everything ready, but i don't have courage. Even recorded all rude things they said and i will post it on some online audio thing. But i won't register there. I will put that audio like files in mediafire or 4shared but without registering and that makes it all anonymous. Any quick help?@@1
91@@ I hope my post will help some find some relief in whatever battles they are going through, whether it be a way you can connect with me or someone in terms of being able to relate to a topic, or just to feel as though you are not alone. As I have tried typing this many times and spinning through my head, I hope my comments and words make sense. I still question to this day why certain things happen? Why people react the way they do? Just life in general. Is there such thing as being born in the wrong time, place, or even wasn't supposed to? Yes, I know I suffer more than some people while at the same time, I don't suffer as much as others do. Why do I never fit in? Why am I so ugly? Why am I never good enough? Why do I always be the last choice (that is if I'm not forgotten)? Why must I live in agony so others can live on peacefully? I get compliments from people, but they never go anywhere. You have such a beautiful singing voice. You have such beautiful eyes. You have such a kind soul. You are such a beautiful person. Everything they say though, you know is a lie. What entitled people to judge you based on your looks? Based on your abilities? Based on your talents? Sure, those are fine and dandy, but what good is it to have anything when it all ends up hurting you and leads to suffering? What did I ever do to make you hate me for something I have or can do? What did I ever do to you so you would take advantage of me? What did I ever do to you to make me think you were my friend and you just abandon me, make me look like a crazy person, just to let me die eve more? What did I ever do deserve any of this? Maybe it's not something I did, perhaps not. Maybe it was a past life that was so horrible, I get to pay the price now. No one is there to help you up when you fall. All around you are masks, cowards, or trash. Vultures ready to pick at what is left behind. Giving your everything and more, just to be left even more empty than what you had. To always be cursed to see the beauty and love of others, and never get even an ounce of it. Only to be given the fake and see it crumble. Only to be taken the light out of and leave you out in be cold, dark night. No light, no stars, just abyss. I hate everything about me. What good is my talents when I'm not distinguished enough? What good is my personality when I'm just a door mat that is constantly stepped on. What good is my intelligence when all it is ever used is for others gain, pleasure, and my pain? What good is it to be healthy physically when you are decaying emotionally? What good is it to have a body when no one ever sees it as something loving, worth of love, something to long for, and just something to give sorry for? Yes, some say if only I had someone love me, I would be happy. Others claim money and fame will fix it. Others just need time. However, just with everything, I'm always the exception. Yes, there are a lot of physical things that could bring me relief, but it wouldn't be worth it in the end. I wouldn't and won't give anyone the chance to hurt me again. No, I do not want to get better just to go back deeper in this hole. No, I cannot bring myself to commit suicide because I could not bear the fact it would cause others pain. I'm not about that. So in the end, I must endure suffering for others pleasure. I'm always the elephant in the room. I'm always the sacrificial offering. I never have a say in this. I never have anyone to love me. I'm a nobody. I'm a nothing. I'm not alive. I roam this realm not wishing bad of others. I roam this realm not wanting to kilo myself. I roam this realm wanting to give everything I can to those who wish to be alive, who have that spark still. I roam this realm wishing I go to sleep, and never wake up again. I probably will not see anything as for the fact I don't care about life anymore. No one would ever give me a chance. No one will ever get to know me. Even if they were to, it would only end in misery for me. So remember, trust no one, as the only person who should let you down (if any) is yourself. Humans are all stupid creatures. I wish to be a shooting star, giving hope to those who see it while doing the one thing we all have in common, dying. Again, only time will tell what happens to everything here, so just resume with everyday life, waiting for the miracle to occur, or the last time you fall asleep. Sweet Dreams. Noonetoanyone@@5
92@@ Only by loosing everything I can have freedom... I understand what it means now. I was working so hard to get a better job so I can finally afford to rent separate apartment and buy a car and go to vacation and buy a new clothes... But I am dropping from the university right now. I was dreaming to get a family and loving man so I can share my life and my love with them since I never had a normal family myself. But I am experiencing another bad breakup. When I was a kid, for a birthday I was getting a pair of pants or jacket. I was dreaming then to have a wardrobe full of clothes. Right now I am giving away to a charity almost all my clothes and keeping only few pants and jackets... I was dreaming to feel better, to get rid of my depression and anxiety, to be normal. But now I am accepting my mental health illness and learning how to live with it. I lost  my dreams, hopes, plans for a future. Tomorrow I'll be 30 and I lost everything. I am taking one suitcase and heading to another city where people speak different language. I don't know what is going to happened next, but I finally feel free from my plans, dreams, things I collected for years, relationship I try to build... I lost everything, I let go, and now there is a new life ahead of me. Will it be better or worst... no matter. It will be different.@@5
93@@ One year ago I lost everything, my home, possessions, majority of my ""friends"" and most importantly my fiance. I never cared about a nice life or material things, just my love. When this happened I fell into a deep depression. I have always struggled with depression but this was different. I had made an attempt to take my life but was unsuccessful. Afterwards I sought help from my closest friend. He did everything to help me, as my family did. Nothing changed. I went to therapy, took meds, exercised, and socialized all to no avail. My friend pleaded with me to give it time. ""One year"" he said, ""Please just wait one year. If nothing has changed and you still long for death then I can't stop you."" I loved him too much to deny him this request. It has been a year now, and still I have felt nothing but misery and despair. I never feared death, and have long since come to terms with my end. Now, I want to show my family and friends that I love them and I want them to understand. I don't know what to do, how could anyone ask another to be okay with their passing? I want my memory to be one of love in the end. I don't want to leave them with only pain@@1
94@@ I JUST WANT TO FUCKING DIE PAINLESSLY. WHY CAN'T I JUST DIE IN MY SLEEP. I LIVE EVERYDAY TO DIE AND PRAY IT WON'T HURT THAT BAD. WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER.@@4
95@@ My whole life is pain unceasing really. I have almost constant physical pain cos of an illness i have. And its not just one kind of pain its a multitude of different ones. So it winds up being like torture. And then on top of that ive had full on life long depression. The depression is very bad now and the pain is never ending. I just cant see how anyone could live my life and do it. I dont see how i can keep carrying on really the way it has got now. I did so much to try and improve my health but its a life long condition and it has a myraid of terrable awful symptoms that just make it hellish. When i was at my deepest depression i believed i might actualy have died at some point and then i was living in a hell world now. I am bedbound, with the curtains shut all the time cos im light intolerant. I dont see anyone but my carers and my dad. I have no other support at all and cant imagine my life with out my dads help. But its the pain that makes it all unberable. As i type this i have a searing burning sensation in my legs that ive had the last 4 hours. Then it will change later to a different pain elsewhere and so it goes on.@@5
96@@ //I have nowhere to vent so if this is long I apologise. I just need to tell someone all of this before I explode. Yeah, I know I could go to therapy and I've been trying but it's been almost two months, including a temporary section in a psychiatric ward and still nothing. No help. I've been planning for a while now, and I'm close to the end. I can't do it right now, as much as I'd like to because I'm in a situation where I don't want the person I'm staying with currently to find me. It's very situational but I don't want to go into details. And please, if you think that the fact I'm not killing myself because of this is a good enough reason for me to keep going, it isn't. I know they'll be hurt either way, but I owe them the chance to find my body. I self harm pretty much everyday, which I've never done before. I used to do it weekly, even monthly, but now it's almost a daily ritual. I see no hope and I see no future. At all. I've been miserable since I could understand things properly as a child, I had severe anger issues and before I discovered self harm I harmed those around me. I took anger management but that only aggravated me. Then when I turned 12 I learned what self harm was.  I'm 19 now. I still harm myself a lot, in different ways. It's an addiction that I can't and don't want to quit. My first bout of suicidal thoughts was also at 12, but wasn't strong enough to drag me into its grip. It was more curiosity. I first got really suicidal at 14, and very almost killed myself. There's a LOT more to why I am this way, what I've gone through etc but I don't want to share so much detail about that. So I'm just going to spill details. This is mainly just about how I feel lately, etc. Anyway, I was being severely bullied, was discovering myself (I realised I was pansexual) and felt very alone because I had no one who shared my interests whatsoever, and I went from having a whole bunch of friends who felt like family at my previous school, to being a complete loner. I'd just sit up all on night on my laptop watching YouTube videos and other things. I was going to kill myself in school, for some reason. I'm still not sure why. I pussied out, however. But this time I won't, because I've never ever felt so suicidal in my life. Last year I had a suicide attempt and I thought that was the worst I'd ever been, until this all hit me. It usually passes after about a month but it's getting on for three months now. It's not passed and I have 0 faith that it's going to. And my life has been 80% misery anyway... I don't see any reason to keep going or 'stay strong' when all this time has been constant misery, and will continue to be that way. There's so many reasons for my decision to kill myself, so many... myself, humanity, society, how the future looks disgustingly bleak, not just for me but for the world. The fact that I can't connect with anyone anymore, not even my Mum. I can't make conversation, at all. I'm a loner. A total loner. The only time I can make moderate connections is online and even then, I have to try REALLY hard to do or say anything. Everyone is so fake it disgusts me. Even I'm fake. I've become a hardcore misanthrope, and if I don't kill myself I'll probably end up doing terrible things. I'm so sick of absolutely everything. Life is futile, meaningless and my wish is to abandon it. //This isn't every reason I'm going to kill myself, because the other reasons are too much to say. Please don't try and help me or give me words or advice/sympathy, etc because I've heard it all and I'm numb to it. I saw my Mum crying on the phone to my Grandma because she's worried about me yet I felt nothing. I'm empty to everything.@@1
97@@ I've had enough, I'm drained. Whether it happens tomorrow or 20 years from now it's a relief to know it's over.@@4
98@@ I'm not sure whether to post this in the Depression or Suicide sub-forum, since it kinda fits into both, but I've been really depressed lately. Everyone that I get close to ends up leaving, and it's always my fault. My own behaviour has caused just about my entire family to not even care, save my sister who is my parental guardian, and is probably gonna stop giving a shit about me at some point, and my niece, who is only 10 and will probably grow up to do the same. It's happened with close friends too. About a week ago, I noticed that one of my friends hasn't talked to em inf orever. I messaged them saying I missed them. ""Mmk"" was what I got back. That's when it started up again. Then, I was talkign to another friend, only to realize that she planned on commiting suicide later in life. She says that she's numb, she can't feel anything and that she's basically pushed all her friends away. She isn't the only one of my friends who ahs told me that she plans to kill herself later on in life. It hurt equally both times. Then there was a new girl in my school who quickly started to become a pretty good friend. Then something happened with her and another student. She reported it to the school and mentioned that I was sitting with her and that student at dinner the Monday of that week. The student had showed her something, she mentioned to the school that she hadn't agreed to watch it, but then I told them that they did. That Friday, i texted her after school and she told her that she was mad at me. I've been purpousely avoiding her since then. All this week I've hardly left my room. I stopped talkign to my friends, didn't eat, and spent the days lying in my bed, wallowing in my own depression. By the end of the week, I started feeling better. then something happened with one of the friends that made me fall again. Instantly, those feeling I had all week came back. I was calling myself a useless piece of shit, a fuck up, someone who can't do the simplest things right. I can't keep a friendship, every time I try it ends in disaster. My friends say they will never leave me but so many people have said that before. They ended up leaving. I felt completely useless, like all my friends were better off leaving me before I made our friendship worse. I guess i wanted their last memories of me to be the happy kid I used to be. One of them even said I've changed and they wanted the old me back. They said that this me was the reason everyone was running. I don't know how much longer I can take this. I'm starting to feel suicidal again and I just don't kow what to do. I've even decided that I'm gonna take Monday and Tuesday off of school so I can just lay down and be alone. I've tried getting help from my friends but it always ends badly, with either an argument or I'll just say 'fuck this' and I'll stop replying. My sister is coming to pick me up today, I live at my school's campus, and she knows that I'm not okay. She told me that she wants to know what's going on and I just don't know what to tell her.She's probably just going to go on about how people do care about me, but that's just not how I feel. And even if people do, why? Why should someone waste their time caring about someone like me? There's nothing special about me. Everything someone thinks they can see in me, they can easily find in someone else, someone better. i didn't always feel like this. I thought I got over this depression a long time ago. Then all my friends started leaving. I developed this fear of losing people. maybe it started when I lost my mother, or my first real girlfriend, but either way, it's happening. I've lost a lot of people I really cared about in the past couple of years and thinking of losing all the people I have now, scared the shit out of me. I guess I realized that there was nothing that I could do. I guess I just gave up.@@3
99@@ Hi. Nice to meet you all. I'm Ashley. I've suffered with depression essentially all my life (maybe it's just a severe dysthymia). I was diagnosed with PTSD months ago as well. I stopped taking my meds recently and of course right when I did that everything fell apart. I'm just sitting here crying in a panic state. I've been suicidal. I feel like if there is a god, he only put me here to make me suffer; to see how long I could take it before ending my own life. I always thought God put me here to laugh at me and make fun of my mistakes. I have never had self esteem, and I don't think it's something I will ever acquire. I have too much evidence to prove that I really am a piece of shit. I'm 22, going to be 23 soon. Looking forward to getting to know people on here, even though the feeling is likely not mutual. No one wants to know another depressed worthless 20-something.@@1
100@@ I have already decided I am going to kill myself. It is really just a matter of getting things in order. i cannot live this way any longer. My disorders have taken everything away from me. Doctors keep putting me off. There are no answers. Everything keeps coming back normal. Nothing helps. New medical problems year after year after year. Why should I live just to give others peace of mind....I don't see my family...don't care to. Why live so others can feel good about the fact that I ""live."" This is not living. I live in a prison every single day of my life. No joy...no nothing....do not shower, do laundry, do anything...I am non-functional. Why should I have to carry out my life just so others can feel better. Things have not gotten better. It has been about 20 years of hell...I am 35. There is no hope and I REFUSE to ""live"" this way. I am so done.@@1
101@@ I hate how out of control my anger is. Today, I hit my husband because I should have let him know I was running out of Lexapro earlier. It is very clear to me that I am turning into my abusive father. I cried in the basement closet, asking God why he didn't kill me over and over. My husband talked to me and thought it was either my birth control or the lack of Carbatrol that caused the incident. I don't want to go off birth control (Junel Fe, BTW) because I fear getting pregnant, nor do I care to go back on the anticonvulsant Carbatrol. Let's face it, I am a hopeless case and God's mistake. Why did he even bother creating me? And why didn't a different sperm fertilize my mom's egg? No man, not even my husband, wants to be around an aggressive woman. I don't want to give up, but someday, I may not have a choice.@@3
102@@ Hi, I'm RobertsGirl and I'm tired..... -I've had suicidal thoughts everyday since I was 12 -I'm now 25 - I grew up in poverty in the south, I'm the 5th child out of 6 to a single parent. -Suffered through verbal and physical abuse from parents and severe racism from teachers as a child. - Went from being a budding high fashion model to living in my cities poorest area with a mentally ill parent, broke, unemployed and 40 pounds over weight in 5 years. - While trying to reach my dreams my parents sucked my bank acct dry for room and board, I ended up homeless, and hopped from job to job at 20. - I met a man and fell in love with him, he suffers from depression too. We are from 2 different worlds but he's everything I wish I could've been. My depression and suicidal thoughts then got worst after I met him, myself esteem then plummets. - 3 months ago I was put in a mental hospital after I broke down at my job. - I'm back a square 1 for the 5th time. I've flunked out of college twice because of finances, scared to go back to the modelling world and want to break up with my bf cause he deserves better, I'm literally at my worst. - Have absolutely no familial support. My parents and siblings are fucked up, luckily I'm the least messed up. - After I left the hospital it has gotten worst. - Questions God every morning when I wake up. I just want my existence to end. I used to cry for myself in the closet as a child and here I am 25 still doing the same thing. I don't want to hurt my bf. I know if I took my life it would crush him. I hate God sometimes for giving him to me. It's like my life is some evil trick. He suffers because I do. And I hate myself for it. So now I just pretend I'm fine. I really just want this to end....@@2
103@@ Hi all. I don't usually post here, but I was thinking about this, and I thought this would be the best place to post my thoughts. People always discourage suicide, and I often read the phrase ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" However, I don't think this is true. Sometimes the problem is really permanent, and not at all temporary. I'm currently feeling this way, and my problem permanent. I've posted my story when I first registered. Here's a link to the post: . Except that now I'll be 24 in less than two weeks. In less than two weeks, I'll be 24 years old with no romantic/sexual experience whatsoever (not even a kiss), and I'm still struggling to know what is wrong with me. In that post I've explained about my situation, and how it's all not by choice. It simply makes me lose my mind. I'm literally losing my mind, and then they tell me it's temporary. No, no it isn't. I've been this way ever since I started wanting a girlfriend. It's not at all temporary. No person can still be sane after being forced to be alone forever. It's even negatively affecting every other aspect of my life. I have no motivation to do anything anymore, including trying to pursue a partner. Part of it is the fact that I know I'll fail at it. Women don't realize what I want from them, and I end up getting rejected (I've elaborated my problem in the linked post). I highly doubt you've ever heard of someone my age who doesn't have romantic experience and not by choice. I mean some people choose to be this way, but this is not the case with me. This is something I very much want, yet no girl has ever wanted me, and I'm confident no girl ever will. I seriously spend almost my entire day thinking about this and getting depressed about it and at times so angry that I break stuff.@@3
104@@ I don;t really know why i am bothering to post this. I feel like I am becoming reclusive in my life. I feel like another every single day. A nuisance. Something very unnecessary to life. A sack of meat. What a sick way to think.... I do not understand my thoughts lately. I think constantly of ending my own life. I do not want to wake up tomorrow. I do not want to fight anymore. I don't want to force myself to live. All I really want is a little love and affection I think. I do not have that. The friends I did have have moved on in their lives. To more serious, solidified parts. They spend a lot of time with boyfriends, which is fine and I understand or try to, but no longer do we talk every day or even every other day. No longer when I call and tell them I am down do they try to make me see reason when I can't find it alone. My family does not believe mental illness exists. Sometimes due to this I think i am simply unstable and crazy. I lost my very best friend. He was my husband and he left out of the blue one day. I still miss him. This was well over  year and a half ago. But he is not the cause of my hopelessness. I do not always feel iike there is a reason, It scares me. Because I can be very happy in life and very uncomfortable at the same time. I feel like I do not deceive happiness. I experienced some abuse growing up- mostly verbal, some sexual. I used to cut and I was in psych ward for a bit. I do not understand anything anymore. I don't want to wake up tomorrow but I know I will because I will make myself. There is part of me that is terrified of going to Hell from committing suicide. And there is also a part of me that feels like I deserve Hell. I don;t know why. I don't know why I hate myself so much except that I feel like a bother. I feel like an inconvenience  to everyone around me. I feel like no one would notice I was gone if I was to die. No one would care. What terrifies me is here lately I have been unable to drag myself out of these thought processes. I have not have the mental strength to pull myself out and say hey girl there is more to life than you think You are more valuable than you think. I can;t find that value anymore. I look in the mirror and I just see sadness. I don't know why I am sad. I can;t give a specific reason and I am so tired of people asking for reasons. I feel like I am lying all the time when I say I am sad for this reason or that reason. It does't feel like the entire truth.Yes it makes me sad but I was sad before then. I have been sad since I was a little girl. I remember wanting to commit suicide at age nine. I hated myself so very much and I still do. I don't know how to love myself anymore. I don't know how to find value. I had planned for the past couple of months now to kill myself tonight. I have been sitting here thinking about it. I have cried and cried at the idea of ending my own life. I have felt confused and conflicted, angry. I don't want to die but I am so very tired of waking up every morning feeling this fog, this burden of sorrow. I am of faking the biggest grin. I am probably one of the most ""cheerful"" people I have ever met, but it is all a lie. I don't even know how to admit the truth in my reality anymore. I guess that is why I turned to the internet. To speak my mind and my fear. My confusion. I just want to crawl into a hole and disappear. I do not wan tot exist anymore. I find no value in who I am. I don;t even know where to begin. I just thought I would finally tell someone. I feel like every day I am trapped inside my own head. I do everything for everyone. I volunteer. I give up my own possessions so someone can have what I have, enjoy it, love it. I like to bring others joy because I know what it is like to be absent of joy. I am so absent lately. I do not know what to do anymore. Everyone I ask for help turns away. They don't know how severe it is. How scary. I am too afraid to tell. Too afraid they will completely abandon me.@@2
105@@ I'm extremely suicidal. I lost the one person I cannot live without. I've tried to attempt suicide 4 times already, but my fear has always gotten the best of me. Please help!!!!@@1
106@@ My job of 20 years is gone.  I have ""mild"" sleep apnea, but even with treatment I'm still really tired all the time.  It doesn't go away.  Yes I want to die, but I'm afraid enough to hold back.  When my money runs out then I will be homeless.  Its over for me, hopefully my body will catch up with what my mind knows.@@3
107@@ Go ahead and be as honest as possible please. I want some outside perspective on me. The thing is. I see other people soar through life easily and do things that are so hard for me easily. Like get relationships, friendships that actually care about them, people that admire and desire them meanwhile I get none of those things. Skewejdjelqllwkw. Whjfjwkaksn. Why does this fucking happen to me? To me to me to me to me to fucking me. As you can see I am already going insane. It makes me so indescribably angry to be that inferior person. Why though? I beg  anyone to tell me the real reason. What is the difference between me and others?  What am I doing wrong that they are doing right??? Uat9'@@4
108@@ So I'm here to make a rational decision. Pros - life is really difficult. I don't see it getting any better. The pain will end. This is the big one. I just want the pain to end. The loneliness and the worthless human being that I am. I want to stop the isolation. Cons - my kids will be upset (this is debateable), a bad example to the kids, I really enjoy my kids sometimes (not all the time), I really enjoy cups of tea, I like the colour of my kettle (see my kids are yelling at each other again, one child ruined another's book, yell yell yell), I don't know, I like stuff sometimes. That's about as rational as I can get right now. Method, I haven't decided yet. Thanks for listening. Also where to leave my kids as I'm a single mum.@@2
109@@ I fell in love with a professsor. He provided me with some emotional support and I loved it, craved it and was 100% completely emotionally dependent on him. The thing is, while he is capable of being nice, he's also the meanest person I've ever met. He tells students their work is worthless or trash, sometimes when he is mad. I just had a meeting with him and I feel like shit. I'm REALLY, horribly over sensitive. I have been this way my whole life. I can't even achieve my goals without feeling super hurt and sad in the process. I can't work closely with a professor because every other sentence that comes out of their mouth is HUMILIATING for me. I feel like I'm being attacked. My emotional skin is being scraped raw. ONE semi mean statement leaves me brooding and butthurt for days or weeks or even months. The tiniest things leave emotional scars on me. What is normal for other people feels like harassment to me. I don't know how I can get through life like this. People say people with borderline personality disorder are like people who have no emotional skin. Well, I don't have it that bad... I would say I have very thin emotional skin though. I can't even get through one day without someone accidentally hurting my feelings. My prof probably thought I had a good time or I learned a lot or whatever but actually, I walked out of his office wanting to cry and also wanting to die. Almost thinking about suicide. Why am I like this? I have goals and dreams I want to accomplish. Everyday, I have to be So careful about avoiding ""mean"" people so I don't get my feelings hurt. When I do get my feelings hurt, it lasts for days and weeks and I can't function. Sometimes I'm too scared to encounter people at all because I know the aftermath. I could become a recluse BUT I want to pursue my dreams. If my professor doesn't think I'm a good person, then I feel worthless and want to die. I feel like giving up this research project with him...because I feel worthless when hes not super affirming of me. .. Its my dream though. I just want someone to tell me that I'm a good person no matter what. That no matter what happens I will still be a good person and deserve to live. That people wont hate me and I will be loved. I want to know I am still a good person even if I make mistakes. I'm so scared of making mistakes in life. Even one hurtful comment hurts me a lot. My prof said 10 mean things to me. My system is in shock. To normal people, these probably wouldn't be a big deal. It was mostly his tone of voice and he was teasing me. It hurt so much. ): My sensitivity makes me so hurt I want to give up and die. Now I have to suck it up and go back to my professor because I need to finish something. I risk getting more emotionally hurt but I have no choice if I want to finish this project.@@3
110@@ hi readers. im a lonely, skinny, ugly and depressed boy at the end of hes 19 years alive. i dont have much left to live for. all i seek is someone to talk to. not to give me any crap that i should not  commit suicide, but just to be there for me. if you read this and think that you may want to talk to me or hear me out, or just to hear about ''my journey'', i welcome you.@@1
111@@ Hi everyone. I hope you're all doing good. I found this forum by chance, and decided to give it a try. I feel I must say though, I've tried other forums and members failed to understand me, so I would appreciate it if members here did. To begin with, I'm a 23 year old guy. A software developer and a musician. I've been severely depressed for a long time. The reason for my depression is something I'm sure nobody here (almost anywhere, for that matter) can actually relate to. In short: I've never ever in my life had a girlfriend. Now, I'm sure you'd like to think, ""Oh, how sweet, he's waiting for the right girl."" Well, not really. The truth of the matter is, never ever a girl liked me before. Believe it or not, I've never experienced what it feels like to actually be liked by someone. You have no idea how much this hurts. Please be aware that the problem is NOT that I'm picky. I've literally never had a girl want me. I've never even kissed a girl in my life. Never held hands. Again, and I emphasize, it's NOT by choice. I have a condition that makes it hard (almost impossible) for me to interact with girls in a non-platonic way. I don't intend to mention the name of the condition because nobody will believe me. It's not a well-known issue. All that combined with the fact that I've been rejected by every single one of the few girls I was able to approach in my life, finally made me seriously contemplate suicide. I'm a member on another forum dedicated to my condition that I post on. The purpose of this thread more than anything is to make people more aware of a serious problem that is being ignored, and see how you will react to this, and hopefully find some support maybe. I know of a few suicide cases because of this problem. I've never experienced intimacy, supposedly the most amazing aspect of life, and most likely never will. :( P.S.: I'm not here to seek advice on how to meet a girl.@@3
112@@ it's horrible i hate life if you say there's hope, nope. human's are fucking scum scum bags no respect for other creatures we aren't how humans are supposed to be. it's a pitty, life is all about fortune and pride - a higher class means you're a better person there are a few people who don't care about money selfish pigs in this world i really would like to kill myself not for attention i'm serious i've simply had enough of being in this filthy world. i just want to kill myself some way@@2
113@@ So here's my story,which has very little value,as I'm an awful person. My girlfriend of four years soon,has been very suicidal for the past two years. Depressed,& she harms herself regularly. It's never that bad,& are few,but it's self harm none the less. I made the biggest mistake I could have. For the last year..we've been relatively on and off..as a way of coping,she would often take any and all anger out on me. I'm the only one who really tries to help her,as she has a rough relationship with her mom. And her dad died,the main source of her depression,besides the fact her mom is very cruel and stubborn. The other,is my mistake. During this time,I didn't feel loved by her. She would take her anger out on me,saying things like I'm useless & I should die. That I'll never be good,etc. I was very angry,and during the time I flirted and even talked sexually with one her friends. That was,a huge mistake and only proved I'm a huge piece of human filth. This only upset her even more,and now she can't trust me. We're still together,but again,she doesn't believe any of my affections (understandably) and her suicidal threats are more frequent. We're young,and I may not know true love..but it's the closest thing to love I can feel at this age. We're 16..I know this situation may not seem valid anymore,because everyone says were too young,& it's not serious. But it hurts. I'll go over everything as it might've seemed like a jumbled mess. I essentially cheated on her because of ignorant anger,& I didn't feel like we were together,and I only made her depression worse. Now she's even more suicidal,& she lives almost an hour away from me. I feel like I truly love her as much as I can. I just don't know what to do to help her. Nobody out where she lives cares for her,& her family isn't a family. They're all judgmental people. Her friends aren't much help either,they say they care and they'll be there for her,then don't talk to her until 2/3 months later. She's afraid of being sent to a mental hospital too. Now that I've seen I've only made her situation worse,I feel sick and disgusting. I'm always wanting to hurt myself,or even kill myself. But I always think of my family,my life,& my few good friends. And even when I can somehow get past those thoughts,I'm too much of a coward to give God my life. I even consider sometimes,taking a few beer cans from my dads packs. Maybe over time,my organs will finally give out on me if I binge drink enough. I'm suicidal,my girlfriend is suicidal. I just one somebody to help..mostly for her. I'm such an awful person who deserves to feel pain for what I did,yet she lets me be by her side. And even being by her side,she says she wants to give up. Please,anyone,I'd like some advice. I don't wanna be sick and disgusting anymore,I don't want her to feel like dying anymore,I want life to be happy.@@4
114@@ I really wish so. I hate life. I have few talents, I am very self conscious and have bad esteem. I have no friends. I can't talk to people without going red. I can speak to one person but more I get embarrassed and nervous I hate it. I just hate life, it's FULL of rude ignorant people I just wanna kill myself so bad@@3
115@@ My name is Bryan. I have this condition called 46 xx male and it is a rare 1 out of 20000 birth defect and I have it. It is the most awful thing in the world. I fell into severe depression and anxiety and completely lost the will to live throughout my teens and early adulthood and had no idea what was wrong with me. I was not even told I had this problem or got help till my I got engaged and my mom was shaking when she told me afraid I would hate her for it. To make things worse I have a verbally abusive father who makes fun of my birth defect and makes me sound like a junkie for needing Testosterone shots every week. He lies straight to my face, mistreats me, and my siblings and make me feel like worthless crap. I feel so alone and sad. I don't feel normal. I don't feel like God wanted me to be happy and cursed me to never have a family of my very own or to even get married and have love for the rest of my life which is the only thing I want and care about in life. My parents tried TRT only once when I was 8 years old and the doctor was not authorized to give me that and should be in JAIL because he was giving me a dose of 1000mg for an 8 year old which is the equivalent to that of a full grown body building man and I could of had a heart attack or stroke. I went through an array of forced growth spurts which had me in agony crying on the floor for the next month or so and I remember crying to go to the doctor and my mother said she would take me but than she said I didn't need to go after calling my doctor finding out it was the testosterone. During that time my brain chemistry got completely screwed up and I had very strong sexual thoughts for those few months and I was only 8!!! I had a forced puberty and had a beard at the age of 9  which disappeared a year or so later and my puberty slowed to a halt. I got supper aggressive and snappy and was always in pain. It scared the crap out of my parents and took me off which during the next 6 months to a year my body had to go through a complete withdrawal which damaged me further at a young age. around 12-14 the depression and anxiety began to take over my life and I couldn't even sit in a classroom and had to run to the bathroom with my heart fluttering and tears running down my cheeks.  I didn't feel right around boys or girls and barely had friends and I didn't even know I had it at the time. I was only told at the age of 21. During my teen years  I fell behind in school and so did my grades. I saw no interest in life and hated every moment I breathed. I completely lost the will to live. I went to a christian high school here on Marco Island in Florida called WCA for one year where my depression was just getting worse and worse along with the anxiety. I got a chest infection and that put me in the hospital for a few months because I have terrible Asthma and  I had to be put on a machine and medication which I had a similar occurrence in middle school in 8th grade. My life just worse and worse. The credits I earned at WCA weren't valid and I was taken into home school where I fell further behind and pretty much was giving up. I hated everything, wanted everything to end, had very little to no friends, and had no will to even do the things I loved. I was developing incorrectly and I began shaking and crying throughout the day just at home. I would hide in my room and hurt myself blaming all my families problems on myself. I couldn't function. I just shook and cried and prayed for help. I don't know why but I just couldn't stop shaking and crying. I would break out in tears in front of my mom telling her I wanted to die, that I don't know what is wrong with me but I can't stop feeling sad and worthless. I couldn't even go out to eat without needing to escape to the restroom to be alone. When I was young in elementary school I was black mailed and repetitively raped by and older man maybe in his thirties at school which just added to my depression and feeling of worthlessness and made me feel like I didn't deserve love or a family of my own. At the age of 21 which is my current age which I turned around Sep 20th I was told in Nov about my problem and finally went to doctors and began TRT with Androgel around December. I was extremely disappointed as it wasn't working and it was now January at the time. Around month 5 I began to have a bit more confidante and have a more of ""I don't care I'll risk it attitude. I go to the gym regularly and lift which is more of a therapy for me than it is exercise as it helps relax me and focus on one thing other than pain. I still feel worthless and depressed. I finally finished high school in July of this year 2015 through Penn Foster with a GPA of 3.7 which could of been a lot better. I'm working on getting a car and better job as at the moment I'm working for my father and its unbearable as I am mistreated, lied too and underpaid.  I feel awful and like a failure in life and I couldn't control my life events. People look at me like I'm a loser for finishing school so late. They act like I'm some sort of incapable worthless waist of life and I am not. I would do anything to be independent and on my own as I hate where I live. My mother died in Feb which mate things worse. She died in her sleep at a hospital. She had sleep apnea undiagnosed and fell asleep losing oxygen to her brain which cause a heart attack and comma. She had barely 2% brain function and we were tol that the night it happened is the night she died yet we didnt lose hope. She stayed with me every night when I was in the hospital but the ONE night she went for a simple pimple infection I wasn't there to wake her up and she died. the next 3 days the doctors violently shook her corpse and opened her eyes trying to wake her up but she wouldn't. they took her off her breathing machine and she couldn't breath without it and after a minute or two she looked like a dead corpse and had to put it one her. The last day her kidneys were failing and they decided to take her off and just let her die. it was the second most horrible thing to happen in my life. that day I started to write an entire novel for my fiance with a ring. I made the book by hand and was around 200 pages in length. The book was a syfy spin off of one of my own series at work but was made to be happier and about how i found the ring for her on a planet and let me remind you that I put forth EVERYTHING for this girl and let me tell you how she treats me. I am engaged and my fiance has been mistreating me and hurting me, making me worry, and playing with my heart. She lies to me, talks to people behind my back and does things she knows that would hurt me and does them out of assumptions that I do the same thing. Then She began trying to decide to throw me away for someone else and than is now with me and tells e she cannot live without me and that she just wants to make sure I'm the one and that I am happy which her actions and cruelty have just left me completely empty and heart broken. I don't feel anything anymore and just hurt and I love her more than anything and just want to spend the rest of my days with her. I have never down anything to wrong her ever and I'm abused even by her. Whatever was left of my happiness, sanity, and soul have been destroyed and crushed. She is everything to me and more and I just want to die to be honest. I have had to much happen in my life and if I can't even have the one person I unconditionally love than screw this life. I'm a male and my chromosomes are female. My body is constantly at war with itself and i need hormones just to function and keep me semi-stable. I feel like I deserve nothing and always hurt in my chest. I always have this burn now in my chest and it makes me cry. I can't smile anymore. The only person who loved me truly unconditionally was my mom and not my liar of a fiance who has claimed that she loves me that much though my love for her is and is why am still with her because all I need and want is her and her love. Also she knows EVERYTHING about me that i have discussed in this message. I feel like I have no purpose. I feel worthless and unloved.I need love. I feel like if I ended my life right now that my fiance wouldn't even give a crap and just move on to the next guy. Did I mention she knows I was raped as a child and of how my life has been? I just want security in my life with her. She said I would never have to worry again, to never look at other guys as options compared to me, and that her main priority was my happiness though it's hard to believe her. I just want to marry her and spend my life with her. I never lied to her and have always treated her fairly. I am a christian but drifting in different directions and at war with my beliefs and thoughts. To be honest.  I feel like my soul is drained and suppressed or just completely destroyed. I don't want to live anymore. I feel pain. LOTS of pain as it slowly converts to hatred and agony. The only love I feel is for my fiance and my little sister. The hatred is directed to myself and I continue to cut and hurt myself. I hate myself. I honestly find myself an abomination and feel like I should just end it and save this world from me using it's oxygen I don't want drugs for anti depression but I am considering since ALL my thoughts are of suicide. I feel numb yet only pain. I feel love but feel betrayal, I feel scars and I make them real on my skin. I feel crazy. I know people will look at me as a nutcase if they saw me hurt myself. I NEED help and I am asking for it or I will eventually end my life one of these days. I wouldn't have typed 10000 or so words if I didn't want help. Is there anyone out there? Please help me. I do not know what to do. All I want is love and marriage and this one girl. I do not feel like a man. I push myself with lifting to try to feel more like a man. I feel lost and I feel out of reach. I fake a smile and crack jokes wherever I go.  I want to die@@1
116@@ Old news but I'm just so damn tired. Physically, mentally, emotionally drained. I've had enough of the bullshit that I let myself go through. These last couple of weeks things have been piling up and up until a couple of days ago, I somehow managed to deal with it. I managed to keep things in perspective, to comfort myself by saying that it was all for the greater good, that somehow someday things will work out. But I don't believe that anymore Counseling is coming to an end, AGAIN. Uni is killing me. My parents still won't try and understand what I'm trying to deal with, they don't want to acknowledge a big part of my problems is related to them. Relationships come and go. The sadness is creeping in, once again. I wish there was a magic pill that would make me fly away. I wish dying could be easier. I'm so scared I want to go back to that dark place where nobody could reach me. I don't know how to get out of this vicious circle.@@3
117@@ I'm a 25 year old man.i have thought  about killing myself since i was a teenager.i always known i wansnt meant to live in this world.i m short and ugly.im not strong enough to do any useful work.im not good at anything.im stupid and slow at learning.so i still dont have a job.everything i do i mess it up.im a dull and boring  and i suck the life out of everything and everyone i get close to.i cant even talk to people.always the wrong things coming out of my mouth.im short tempered and have no patience.people look at me with pity and feel sorry for me.i want to kill myself but i dont even have the courage to do it.i wish to die in my sleep or in some accident.@@4
118@@ I'm almost 30, and since my early teens I've dealt with depression. Maybe earlier than that I've thought a lot about death. I've thought a lot about suicide, sometimes actively, more often passively. More recently my depression came back - creeped up on me - and I've been overwhelmed with passive (slightly active) suicidal ideation. As in, I want to die, but I'm not gonna commit suicide, so I take small steps that might help get me there sometimes. Wanting to die in a car crash, of cancer, some other accident or illness, anything. I find myself trying to find ways to encourage something to happen. But I am too cowardly to do anything major, to cause any real harm or pain. To make it look like I did it either, rather than an accident. i.e. I research about cancer to find out causes and risks, and try tFor awhile now, I've had a passive death wish. I'm sure many here can relate. It's come and gone over many years of my life, at least since my early teens. Sometimes during more deep depression I would have more active suicide thoughts. Before I met my current boyfriend, I even had a full thought out plan. Everything cleaned out in my parents house in case I went through with it. But I found happiness with him and the thoughts disappeared. Now here I am, 7 yrs later, still with him (though we recently went thru a short break up, got back together, are ok now) but the depression creeped back up on me. And I find myself overwhelmed with passive suicidal ideation. Wanting to die in a car crash, of cancer, some other accident or illness, anything. I find myself trying to find ways to encourage something to happen. But I am too cowardly to do anything major, to cause any real harm or pain. To make it look like I did it either, rather than an accident. I research about cancer to find out causes and risks, and try to do things that will increase my risk. I stopped wearing my seatbelt in the car. Sometimes I will speed up and get a thrill almost driving off the road but at the last second change my mind. Hold my breath in the bathtub as long as I can. Obviously my body's stupid survival response kicks in. So I mean the reasons I want to die and give up on life at this point are because mainly I'm going nowhere, I've gone nowhere for so long, been unsatisfied and unhappy for so long, work to live/live to work, despite overcoming an extremely deep depression in my teens and surprisingly graduating high school, depression has found me again several times over the years. Now I'm almost 30 with no prospects. I now have numerous health problems, but nothing super major or terminal, just bad enough to cause chronic pain and suffering on a daily basis. I am actually disappointed when I go to the doctor or the ER and any kind of lab test or imaging comes back normal. Why can't they just find SOMETHING? So I have multiple chronic pain issues to which I take Rx pain medication daily, which I wish I didnt have to, but I couldn't live a decent quality of life, get out of bed or even shower without them. So of course I am now dependent on them. And every time I get close to the end of my prescription and have to wait for the next one, I freak out. My anxiety goes up, I feel like I want to die so much more. I would rather die then be in this much physical AND mental pain. I just can't take it all anymore. One time I thought I wasn't going to get my refill because my Dr was out of town, so the Dr on call said she wouldnt do it and I'd have to wait a few days until my regular doc got back. I literally started bawling my eyes out and started contemplating suicide methods, but quickly gave up and changed my mind. I couldn't do it. I care too much about my dog, my boyfriend, my family. When my boss at work threatened my job security by saying she had a stack of resumes to choose from if I didnt start working more, and be more available, I freaked out and started thinking what am I gonna do. I felt like walking out on the spot and hated myself. I see stuff on TV and that influences me too. I saw a show where a teen drove his car into a semi and killed himself that way, another show a girl slits her wrists in a tub, so I put that in the back of my mind, ""just in case."" But I'm always too cowardly to do it, too worried about what I'll leave behind, or that my 'survival response' will kick in. However I feel one day there wont be much left for me to care about leaving behind, the depression will always be with me, and I'll finally give in to its clutches. I feel like life just won't let me be happy. When I think I've gotten ""better,"" or things are going good for me, something bad happens and I go ten steps back. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. How do I go on and put effort into a life that keeps kicking me down? I have a feeling that if I don't take care of it myself, I'll probably live to like 90, yet it will be mostly stressful, miserable years. And all my attempts at 'getting cancer' wont give me cancer, it'll just make me ill in other ways, and I'll just be more miserable. I know I must sound like a crazy person, and its probably because my mind is diseased with this darkness, but this is how I've always been. As long as I can remember. So to me, I don't feel like it's so strange. I just know I can't talk about it to 'normal people.' But because these thoughts have been so overwhelming lately, and it's weird how the passive death wish is 'active' in a way - that I'm making choices that could affect me, rather than just thinking them - I had to get it out, and see if any others feel similarly. Or maybe I'm just totally crazy.@@4
119@@ i feel so left out from this world, i am a person with no talent, no hobbies, i cant draw, i cant play any musical instrument,i specially enjoy the calm solo trance music but i feel so bad when i hear how good people are at making such things and i am still stuck in this loop of pain , i don't know how to dance good,i don't know how to even talk to people like a normal person with my bad personality, people must think i have some speech disability. all of these beautiful things that i missed out in life just feeling pain while i should have enjoyed it, but is it my fault that life treated my so bad to the point that i forgot how to have fun@@5
120@@ I first want to say I never knew how truly stupid I was, how lacking in self worth, self respect and values.  I am quite simply nothing.  I seriously don't know how to continue on just surviving after yesterday. I hit rock bottom again but it's lower than I have ever sunken before.  Mum says that there is only up now.  If she knew how much I threw my pride away yesterday, I'm sure she would denounce me once again as her daughter, claim her contempt for my lack of courage and any self pride. I didn't go to work yesterday was having another mental break down.  It's all been too much, my mum is dying, my nephew is dying of cancer and I'm quite pathetically still in love with my ex boyfriend.  6 months later he still says he loves me but is not in love and that he wants to be friends.  All I did yesterday was smoke, cry and sleep.  I laid in bed in the darkness thinking of ways to end it all.  I either rang or texted various members of my family crying out that I wanted to die.  If that wasn't bad enough I ended up continually texting my ex, all of my self pride went down from there.  I asked him if he was in love with me (how fucking stupid!!!) he said he didn't love me that way anymore.  How I wish the stupidity ended there.  I then asked him if he could grant me one last favour and hold me one more time.  I said I didn't want to be alone that night.  He said he didn't think that was healthy for either of us.  Of course he said no...he doesn't fucking love me....how fucking brain dead am I?!?!!! I asked him just to leave me alone, that I was hurting beyong belief and just wanted to end it all.  He wouldn't stop texting me back and said he would ring the police if I did anything to myself.  He wanted me to swear I would not try anything.  I told him no, that once I get the balls I'm going to do it.  I cringe, here is this poor guy who's only mistake is that he dated me for a year.  Who now only feels tringes of pity for a mentally fucked up girl that just wants to die.  I still want to die.  I am humiliated beyond belief.  I am my own worse enemy and don't think I could ever look him in the eye again.  Oh how I wished when he broke up with me, I just said okay and went into no contact and stuck it out.  At least then I would of had some pride, that would of been of some solace.  I am fucked but what hurts is that now he knows how much, and who was once a lover is now my enemy and I have let him see how weak I am, how worthless and how pathetic.  He talks to me now like a mentally deranged person, soft tones, sad smile and sympathetic eyes.  He once adored me, now I'm nothing. His little neice was born yesterday and the picture my mind paints of him holding her kills me.  He will never hold our baby.  He use to talk of marriage and children but he will share his future with someone else not me.  Not me. Yes I want to die and figure if the people around me really loved me they would be happy to see me not fight any more with my darkness.  Yesterday showed me that I  am truly alone in my pain.  I am surrounded by family but distant from everyone.  I won't talk about my despair to them anymore...whats the point they can't do anything about it and it just upsets them.  I don't believe in anything anymore.  I have tried so many ways to stop loving someone who doesn't love me.  Researched the internet, unsuccessfully tried no contact (but thats hard working with him), read books, tired to change my perception of the event, tried to hate him, tried to think of him as dead...I have tried in so many ways to go on.  I'm not wanting to die for him.  I want to die for me.  Like I said to him you have 25 years of fighting depression than talk to me.  I believe in God but don't believe he loves me.  I have cried my tears to him, pleaded and begged, got angry and shouted but mostly just wept and asked him to help me accept and move on. I woke up this morning, once again.  And all I want to do is die.@@1
121@@ I can't sleep.  I can't stop my head from screaming at me. I'm a horrible person. My hamster is being put to sleep tomorrow as he's not well and there's no cure. I want to die with him. Need to escape my head and death seems to be the only way. I don't know what to do. I don't know why I'm posting here. I jus have to do something@@1
122@@ I thought I had friends, they all said they'd support me and be there for me then they all vanished once summer began. Even my best friend who reassured me that she'd never give up on me treats me like I don't exist. A week ago I was really depressed and contemplating suicide and I messaged her and pretty much begged her for her helpâ€¦and she ignored it. I got through it but I was so upset I deleted my facebook and cut off all ties with all my friends. There's no one I can trust to actually be there for me. I ended up talking to her again today but only cause she messaged to say I could cancel the Netflix account we share but she wouldn't explain to me what had gone wrong in our friendship. I've asked her if we're still friends but she hasn't responded. I don't know why I'm so worthless that she could drop me so easily. Everyone always drops me like that, even members of my family. I completely hate myself for being so meaningless that none of these people would actually care about me. I just feel completely hollow now. It's like I'm barely feeling anything. I don't want to live like this.@@3
123@@ I'm 2 weeks behind in my rent payments. Prior to that I was working in construction, fast food.. but I quit my job last month.. because I was sick of having screaming matches with my boss over trivial shit like putting forks in the wrong cupboards, being 5 minutes late, putting cheese inside the hot dogs instead of sprinkling it on top, etc. Needless to say, my body was telling me that this wasn't a natural way to live. I stopped going to work, and told him to go and find someone else. I've been living off of internet sales in the past month, selling things on behalf of people for a commission.. and also providing computer repair services. It made me temporarily happier, doing something that gave me an adrenaline rush.. knowing I was bettering myself.. as opposed to selling fucking fast food, where you still earn $10 an hour whether you sell 10 hot dogs, or 100. However, there's no denying that sooner or later, I am going to get nailed for tax evasion.. which is funny, considering how I can barely pay my rent.. and don't even have the slightest clue as to how to go on about paying taxes, considering I'm only a 23 year old lesbian hipster chick who is trying to make it in the adult world. Hell.. I can't even afford to buy myself a GST receipt booklet.. let alone toilet paper, and I'm not making this up. Needless to say, I'd rather kill myself than get another job. I need 5 alarms to get out of bed. I can't even hold a fucking job. I'm literally sleep walking through life. I am already dead. I don't qualify for welfare or disability, either. The way I understand it, suicide hotlines are merely a trap to get the cops to your door and put you away, where you will spend the rest of your life wishing you had hurried up and finished it all. I just don't know what to do. I hate this society so fucking much.. every day chasing the dollar sign. I just want to take a fucking break. It's too much to ask for, apparently.@@1
124@@ I posted my story on here about a year ago, but since I haven't been on here recently, I'll post it again. I first noticed my hair loss about 6 years ago and it drove me to the depths of depression that I've never come close to feeling before.  I take great pride in my outer looks and hair loss has eroded them to the point that I feel like a fragile shell of the confident and outgoing man that I once was, a stranger in my own skin, a man who has lost his identity.  I no longer have the confidence to approach women anymore and I have lost plenty of good friends because I am no longer the fun and personable guy that they used to love to spend time with.  I used to be an avid fan of 80s rock and I even played bass guitar.  However, ever since hair loss hit, I have played my bass at all and no longer feel energized by the music that gave me such joy and inspiration.  It is a sad thing to no longer enjoy something that you once loved with all your heart.  It pains me when I see all of my peers scoring dates on sites like Tinder, while I cannot even go on there due to my extreme discomfort with my eroding looks.  Anyway, I knew that I could not handle hair loss so I went on medication to curtail the hair loss, which was somewhat effective.  One of the problems is that I went on the medication too late so my hair loss is still very noticeable.  Second, and perhaps most important, the medication has caused me horrendous side effects which include gyno, loss of libido, and loss of sexual function.  I incurred these horrible side effects for numerous years but I just cannot deal with them any longer.  Especially since they are so drastically and negatively affecting my sexual function and my weight-lifting due to the gyno.  Yet I am just terribly afraid that I will just absolutely lose my f****n mind if I buzz my head, which I will have to do.  I don't know what to do and it feels like my life is over, and has been over for a long time.  I wish every day that I would die because I feel like a vague shell of the man that I once was.@@2
125@@ So when I woke up this morning I can't believe what my mom said while i was cooking a omelette i had too even though my back is screwed up and I forgot to put oil in the pan and she said u better have not forgotten to put oil in the pan because if you didn't you better make sure you clean it properly I don't want to clean up any mess because if you leave it there it will be better of for me  to commit suicide she said specifics but i am not mentioning to follow the guidelines then she said I'll let your father and brother clean up that mess and that would be the last mess I would ever make......that hurt me so much she said that......I know I don't deserve to be talked to or treated like that.....it just hurt a lot to hear her say that. ....I called her a stupid bitch and I'm just ignoring anything else she says....has anyone ever had a parent tell them something along those line ?  It's so hurtful and uncalled for especially from a parent I feel Life has become utterly unbearable. But not for the reasons many people in this world would understand, so I'll start from the beginning... Growing up, life sucked for me; I had hardly any friends, was verbally bullied, etc, etc. Things changed completely when I went to college and 'met myself', had a great time, and made lifelong friends. Sure, I had the odd breakdown now and again (every few months) where I would cry for absolutely no reason, I was dx'd with depression and tried a lot of different medications and supplements; Piracetam, a nootropic, was the only thing that worked perfectly with no side effects). After graduation at the end of last year I finally pulled myself together (physically and emotionally) and set myself some goals. At the start of this year, 2012, I decided to move to another state and chase my dreams of being a copywriter. And that's pretty much where my dream ended and the nightmare began. I bought a car (an '85 model sedan), a really rundown sports car for cheap. Anyway, it turns out that my car was leaking carbon monoxide (CO) fumes from inside of the engine bay and into the cabin. Little did I know (at the time) that this had been going on for the past 9 or so months since I bought it. It helps explains my severe memory problems (short term more than long term), mutism (lack of speech), blurry vision, chronic fatigue, emotional numbness, and absent-mindedness (which ties back to the mutism) all of which I've been feeling for the past several months; basically I can't express my feelings or thoughts because I feel as though I have none. I can't possibly describe how this feels. It's as if my entire personality - my vivacity, my colour, my vibrance and intelligence has been sucked out from me. I feel like my IQ has dropped at least 50 points. I haven't genuinely laughed in over 4 months. My closest friends and family are starting to seem like strangers because there is no communication, no energy, and no signs of love between us any more - even though they do still love, care for and worry about me all the time. They comment, of course, about how much I've changed, some people are more honest than others when they say things like, ""You've become really quiet,"" ""You seem really nervous,"" or ""You used to seem a lot smarter, ...but it's the silence in conversation that is the worst. Those gaps that remind me that there is a massive emptiness inside me because I've poisoned my brain. No one wants a friend that can't communicate. It's only those few friends that are non-judgemental and I used to be so close with who will still hang out with me, but they will most likely tire of me and my lack of social abilities (and willingness to go out and party *like I used to*). Most of my other friends I refuse to see, making up excuses why I can't see them, because I don't want them to see me like this, I want them to remember me for who I once was. So it's the remnants of friends that I have which keep me company, I cannot make any new ones, I can only recycle the old. I don't get angry nor sad any more - just neutral - just so incredibly numb and empty minded that it drives me insane. I feel dead on the inside. And the worst part is that if I could fully emotionally comprehend the gravity of this situation, I would be kicking and screaming and wishing for a way to go back to who I was. And sometimes I do cry when I realise that this is permanent, that the old me that people knew and loved is gone and has now been replaced by this shell of a person - but to cry about this I really need to force myself, or else it just passes off me with this disgusting apathy and anhedonia that I feel about every single aspect of my life every single day I get out of bed. I'm on disability support for severe depression at the moment because I could no longer handle work and the people there.@@4
126@@ To have been born this way would not nearly have been as bad as having lived a (somewhat) 'normal' life only to have it taken all away. Psychologists? yeah, I've seen a few about this. None of them will agree with me when I say ""I have no emotions, I can't feel anything,"" instead they suggest that people who experience this are 'psychopaths' and 'sociopaths' and are in jail. I'm not a violent person, and the thought of harming other people never crosses my mind. Doctors think it's just anxiety and offer all kinds of 'antidepressants'. I could go to a neurologist, but I know that this type of poisoning is irreversible, so it would just be a waste of time and money seeing one. Medication? sure, I've tried different drugs (Zoloft, Prozac, etc - all of which terrible and only made me gain weight and feel even more numb), but let's talk recreational drugs. Why is it that now when I smoke weed, take adderall, or drink alcohol that I do not *feel* any different (only tired, slightly more awake, and sluggish respectively)? I'm not tolerant to these substances and haven't abused them in over a year. I used to laugh from weed, become focused and  chatty and euphoric from adderall, and feel socially extroverted when I drank, but now I feel almost nothing (besides vomiting or a lack of sleep) when I take these things. So maybe I'm wasting my time writing on this forum complaining about brain damage that could be worse, but nonetheless has made me feel like someone who had so much potential to do things with his life, but has had it all ripped away from him at age 22. I have an amazingly supportive family who loves me very much, and the thought of what suicide would do to their lives seems horrendous. But what's love and support worth when you cannot reciprocate? when you spend half your day laying in bed and wishing that you could just go back to sleep and never wake up? Thus, I am torn, because I want to be neither here nor there. Sartre said that Hell is other people, but I know that , one that I will be stuck in until the day I die. And so I must ask all of you, is suicide really that bad? I don't feel like I'd truly be killing the person *I* am so much as the person I have *become*. I accept responsibility for my actions in that I should have had the car checked out, and that this is of course entirely my fault, but living a 'life' like this hardly seems like living at all.@@4
127@@ I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, in the 23 years that I've lived.. and it seems to me that there really is no such thing as support for depressed people, despite the fact that society has worked extremely hard to create an illusion of its existence. People die all the time.. either as a result of accidents, murder, disease, old age.. etc... the same way gazelles get eaten by lions in the wild. It's a fact of life. We don't give it much thought. We move on with our lives. ...and we in the west happen to live in a particularly ruthless, individualistic society where those who aren't deemed to be productive enough, will eventually succumb to a miserable life, after they've been brushed away and forgotten.. while the media keeps doping everybody with news of rich celebrities getting pregnant and bitching about their breakups, lawsuits and divorces. It is a a certainty that I'm not going to last very long in this world. I don't even know why I'm wasting time posting on this site. We seem to have this preconceived idea that civilization out there to help us. ..No, my friend. Civilization is only there to exchange goods and services for other goods and services. Depressed people offer no such commodities.. and the worst part of all is that there's a lot more suffering out there on the planet. Children being bought as sex slaves in Asia, Africa and the middle east.. men and women dying of malnutrition.. innocent families dying as a result of the collateral damage of warfare.. etc. The world is an evil, monstrous place. Suicidal people would thus we wayyyy down in the list of priorities, but that's okay with me. Before I die - I want to make sure I have donated at least $2000 directly to a family living in Kenya. They deserve it more than I do.@@4
128@@ For what life I have left I'm proud to be a veteran. I never wanted to die but have been ready to be held by Jesus for a long long time. I had hope in VA but that was shattered. I began to pour my heart out and was interrupted. I never talk about it. But I was rudely told they need to send a referral to a local VA place for me. I hope they sleep well knowing they didn't save one. It was probably a computer anyway. Oh well@@4
129@@ Hello all. I'm a 22 years old male, I've been suffering from bipolar disorder in my life from a long time, I'm not on any kind of medication. I'm afraid people may judge me, I just bottle everything up an keep it inside me, just pretend to everyone that I am happy but the truth is I'm dying on the inside.  nothing ever works out for me, I failed in school, I failed in college, I failed at everything and everything I do in life I always end up failing an never achieving anything in my life, everyday of my life I am sad an hurt. I just don't what to do anymore in life. I feel so sad an depressed. Everyday is a new challenge.  Everyday is a new battle I have to face in my life. I'm also sick I've been also suffering from meningitis, stomach ulcers an kidney problems. Nothings really working out. There's only pain within me, mental, physical and emotional an its draining every last bit of me. I always tried my best in life but I always ended up with a disappointment of failing. Its really hard living with this depression. Only death is on my mind. Its like there's no one here for me in life. Clearly I had enough with my life, I think of suicide everyday, its just one day I will snap an burst out, then that would be the very last of me.  The pain is so intense that it leads me to just end it, so all this pain would be over an done with.  I don't really have anyone to ask for help, I don't want to be a burden in anyones life. Please I really need some encouragement and some advise before I do something and hurt myself. Thank you.@@3
130@@ I am new to posting anything on the net but really wanted feed back. I can't go to my family as they don't understand. They would Care a great deal and would do anything to help me but I am getting to the point or rather been past the point for some time. I'm sure most would say this but I've dealt with more suffering and pain in my short 27 years then most will ever go through in multi lifetimes. To be honest the only thing that has stopped me from taking my life is only the fact of my family having to deal with the after effects of my actions but I am getting to the point of leaving somewhere to end it all and just don't know what to do. There is more then just depression or all the deaths in my family that I think about death but Idk I'm lost and feel abandoned by God or the creator or what have you and really don't know what to do anymore.@@3
131@@ Will I carry on with this miserable life? Or do I possess the will to leave this world on my own terms? What will my final days be like? Will I be a shivering lump in the corner...or will I exude a cold calculating calmness as I carry out my final efforts? Does it take more courage to live out your life in a state of near constant mental anguish, or to end it when you reach a point that you cannot take any more of this life? Should I do something on my last days, finish the bucket list, or just live my normal life until the last moment? I have no answers, only more questions...@@3
132@@ I know the ticket to some sort of decent life is all about perception and mentality, but ever since I broke with my ex 4 years ago life's never been the same. I'm pretty sure it caused some sort of mental illness, and I've just felt completely broken ever since. I've tried looking inwards to repair, taking up meditation, but I think that just made things worse. It's just been one crazy drop down the rabbit hole. My mind has been all over the place, not knowing who or what to be. Some say ""just be yourself"" -- but what happens if you don't know yourself? I'm lost in a world of despair and loneliness.@@3
133@@ This is not a mental problem.  Yeah, maybe when I was younger I had mental problems, low self-worth, fear of failure, depression, etc.  Those things did make me the person I am now.  But at this point I don't see any remedy.  I still have the aforementioned things; added to that I have years.  There comes a point where one can't fix it. I don't like it here.  I want to leave.@@4
134@@ I am a good person.  I once had a very prosperous life and most importantly, I really cared and helped people.   But my life has always been secretly fueled by fear of failure.  We'll that fear has manifested and here I sit at 37.  I am alone because I refuse to let anyone close to me in my state.  Moreover, I just can't forgive myself for things I have done in the past and that's not normal.  Why is it like I am stuck and reliving an incident that happened now 10 years ago?  These are the times when yes I don't want to feel pain anymore because this is just how I am and what kind of existence is that? If I don't worry myself to death about life, how am I going to be at 65, 70?   I am truly stuck.  I usually just help others and never help or talk about myself, but even that just doesn't work anymore.@@3
135@@ I'm desperate for help. Hope I get something here, because my suicide thoughts are getting stronger everyday. I'm introverted, but that doesn't mean I have to be alone for too long. I mean, sometimes I try to approach people to help or just to talk, even if it's a bit. I talk about my tastes, but people seem to barely have interest, if any at all. And when I help (just any college/work business) I feel frustrated afterwards - I feel like I was a mere ""helping machine"". Like they have no interest about my life, besides the most basic things anyone has (or not). Now I won't deny that it's my fault in part... But I dunno how much. I mean, I have mediocre social skills. At least I'm thankful of not making people furious (okay who hasn't, but I can count the moments I did, and obviously I won't). But when I talk with someone, it's difficult that I have something to comment about. That doesn't mean I don't try to think what to say, but hardly anything comes to my mind with most of topics. Okay, in fact sometimes happens with things I like as well. I also noticed I'm becoming envious lately. Like I said, I try to approach people, but they barely show interest, and more than once I felt terribly frustrated when they try to talk with someone else. I feel like ""this person is worth more than that shit over there"", even I shouldn't think about that at all, but it's impossible to not feel that, no matter how hard I try. Many say we should vent, but I almost never do that. That's because I don't wanna make people around me gloomy. Because y'know, have you ever felt like that with someone that vents too much? Yeah, I don't wanna be that guy. Oh and also I hate when people vent over their daily life. So much anger around me makes me feel helpless (it's not that much, but it's still part of my daily life). I spend most of time in my house, and I don't like my family. First I'm sorry if I'll sound cruel, since they aren't mean at all. But my dad gets angry very easily, and most of time wants to demonstrate he's right, no matter what. My mom is dumb and she can get histerical with my dad, which obviously scares my brother and I. Oh and I almost don't interact with my brother, nothing else to say about him. I spend almost the whole day in my room, trying to enjoy my hobbies. Yeah yeah, I should go outside, but my city is so boring... I wanna practice karate, but college goes first. I want a whole new life NOW. I'm tired of college (marks are great, it's just the people). My job isn't pleasant. I don't wanna live with my family anymore. But I'm asking too much. I first need to finish college, at least. But after that I dunno... I know NO ONE who wants AND can live with me. I'm afraid of living in mediocre conditions if I moved alone. I'm just glad I have a best friend. Otherwise I dunno if I were alive now. tl;dr: People pisses me off due lack of empathic interaction, and that grows my depression. I want a new environment as soon as possible. Possibly I omited things but all this came to my mind now.@@3
136@@ So now the VA will not allow me to see another specialist for my edema. I have decided that I have given up fighting and advocating for my health. I will now only go for the absolute necessities such as the flu. I am so tired. I have painfully accepted my lot in life as my status quo which I have described before as abysmal. Clearly there is a ton more that perhaps people have already read about my life and current life circumstances. I do not know why there is just no help. I know eventually I will have the courage to kill myself....it is so near I can feel it......there is not much more I can take of this life. I am already thinking of the stuff that I need to take care of.@@4
137@@ I'm not plotting suicide at the moment of writing this. I have what I would call ""extreme"" and ""enduring"" depression, though I've never been diagnosed. Depression for me is pretty much a part of my personality at this point. With my kind of depression, there are no jokes, no funny movies, no songs, no motivational speakers, no good people who can make things better. This depression numbs the impact of all positive influences. Depression doesn't need negative thoughts for its basis, it can thrive off of any thought you give it, positive or negative. My depression stems from deeply-rooted self-hatred. I classify myself as inferior, undesirable, a loser, and less-than. I view myself as inherently undesirable and pathetic. This means that there is no changing it. No matter what I do, what steps I take to change things, these things will always hold true and be parts of who I am. I have good reason to think this too. I'm 25 and unemployed, and live with my parents. I'm lazy, incompetent, stupid, incapable, selfish, awkward, and insecure. I'm a virgin who's never even spoken to a member of the opposite gender. Of my high school graduraing class, I had the single lowest GPA of all non-special-ed students, and the lowest of those who actually graduated. If not for some teachers who felt sorry for me, I wouldn't have gotten my diploma. I was forced to go to a half-baked state university after high school for lack of other options. I spent three years there where I essentially failed every class. There was once class I took 5 times and didn't pass it. I was eventually placed on academic probabtion, and finally academic suspension. I was expelled from college for poor grades. I spent 3 years there and never made it past first-semester freshman status. My cousin has a masters degree from Yale, my brother graduated with honors from Mississippi State Engineering school and is now getting his masters at Duke, and my sister is going for her masters degree as well. They are all smart, capable, and successful. I am pathetic and stupid. I have always wanted to be smart like that and go to a top university, but instead I'm stupid. I've always envied intelligent people who receive acclaim and scholarships and go to top schools. I've always wanted to be that, but I'm just a defective, useless brain with hope hope whatsoever. I couldn't even get into community college now- schools with 100% acceptance rates who will accept a brain-dead vegetable. I've been fired from every job I've ever had. I cannot create good relationships wherever I go because I am such an awkward and stupid person. People don't have respect for me because I often don't meet the standards for respect. Many times I don't even see or understand why I'm being fired or disciplined at work because I think my mind has defects that make me blind to reality and ignorant to what's going on. Needless to say I'm not a good asset to the workplace. Jobs never keep me around long. After they figure out what I am they get rid of me quick. Women also hate me. All of them, not just some, not just MOST of them, ALL OF THEM. I've never seen another guy girls find more revolting and unacceptably repulsive than me. You want a building cleared of all women just tell me which building you want me to walk into. I've tried being kind, funny, polite, interested in what they have to say, flirt with them, etc. They hate me and want nothing to do with me. They know what they want and it doesn't include me. It is truly remarkable how much women dispise me. I've even walked past women on the sidewalk who have said ""don't look at me"" when I make eye contact with them. I've had women come up to me at random and tell me they think I'm ugly. In fact, one time 3 of my friends took me out on the town. We met 4 attractive girls where we were at. There were 4 of us and 4 of them and each guy paired with a girl, accept for me. The 4th girl refused to pair with me so she went home. So believe me when I say, ALL girls that have ever existed, exist today, and yet to come despise the very essence of me. If any of them could leave the planet to get away further away from me they would. I have no achievements other than potentially the highest level of failure imaginable. My siblings were star athletes. My sister was an all-state softball player, my brother was the quarterback. I had no talent, no achievements, nothing. I was just frivolous and stupid. My failures and incopetencies are grotesque and staggering. What I have written about here is only the very tip of the iceburg. Come to think of it, I've never had a success of any kind in my life, unless you consider getting out of bed a success (which I don't). I used to not be like this. I used to be naÃ¯ve and optimistic, thinking things would eventually get better. They didn't, and I've learned alot about how much my existence is a shame and a detriment to everything and every life I touch. So many more worthy people could be breathing the air I'm breathing and consuming the space and resources I'm consuming right now. I am inferior and a poison to the world. I feel that death is virtually the only way to solve the problem of me. I feel that this world belongs to worthy, capable people and the people like me should be done away with. I am trash that pollutes the planet. I don't deserve life. I want to eventually kill myself one day.@@4
138@@ I don't .want to be around any more I had my 3rd attempt at my life Saturday morning and I really thought.that it would stick.but here I am again and surrounded by family who doesn't have any idea what I feel like or what Hell I live in every.day its not one aspect.of my life that sucks its every and I put it of effort Into bettering my situation but its always smashed taken.or  ripped away.at the worst.time. I don't want to start from square one again. Its just not.worth it I just don't know what to do Idea@@5
139@@ I watched in an interview with my favorite singer what she had to say about suicide. Everything we're worried about becomes so irrelevant. if we just give things time it always gets better. it will pass. its great positive advice and most of the time it works for me but lately my current situation makes it so hard. my unemployment always made me think suicidal. i always feel like ""ill never get there things are in the works but i wish it can move along faster and i hope whatever i end up with ill be able to advance into a position that will let me become independent. but if it doesnt im going to stay depressed to the point where i see no point to live. a couple days ago i heard sad news that my sisters friend lost her life in a car accident so that devestated me and it made me fear death lately thinking it could happen to me. whats your advice? i need another positive lift..@@3
140@@ I've tried many times to not wake up in the morning. When I start to wake, I hope I've passed on, but it does not happen. I am not relieved that I'm alive, only that I must try and slog through another day. I have the perfect wife, but each day I struggle with the after effects of whipple surgery for pancreatic cancer.  The pain is seldom under control and my bowels are a mess.  I'm a fraction of myself. I've sought counseling and have called the suicide helpline many times. Each have got me to the next day, but I struggle to care for anything more. I'm taking anti-depressants. I'm just so tired of it all.  It's been four years of each hellish day at a time. I just want peace. My wife is the only thing that can get me to the next day. I see the pain in her eyes. I'll try to see tomorrow for her only, but if I do not wake, I will be okay with that too. I do not understand what life offers. Why babies die, why the elderly are left to suffer. Why I got pancreatic cancer when I tried to live a healthy life and that of a good person. Do I believe in God, yes. His ways, No. Why there is suffering, absolutely not. Any insight would be helpful.@@5
141@@ I donâ€™t know who to address this to, or who I am talking to. I need help and I donâ€™t know where to go. I canâ€™t talk to my wife. I will be scolded or she will get angry with me saying Iâ€™m selfish, or how terrible I am of thinking of leaving her and the kids behind. I think of killing myself now on a daily basis. I work a job where Iâ€™m gone all the time, Iâ€™m lonely without my wife. But then that takes me to the topic of her. She thinks I donâ€™t love her. I show her that I love her, I tell her that I love her. When Iâ€™m home, if I show excitement towards something and not towards her as well, it means that she is just a side thought. She is upset that Iâ€™m not as physical as I used to be with her, which in part is true, but has nothing to do with her. I donâ€™t know what is wrong with me, I havenâ€™t fallen out of love with her, Iâ€™m still attracted to her. I think it might be the constant stress of feeling like Iâ€™m walking on eggshells in order to keep from upsetting her or making her feel less than she is to me. She says I shouldnâ€™t have to try to show her, but I donâ€™t â€œTRYâ€ because I do love her. I show her in the ways that is me, but it isnâ€™t enough. She says that she needs to change herself and accept the way things are and stop hoping for the fantasy in her head. I feel I canâ€™t live up to her expectations ever. I try so hard to be myself, which at first seemed ok, but as time progressed, it hasnâ€™t been enough. When it boils down to it, she doesnâ€™t do a whole lot towards me either anymore. When I am home, she just sits in her chair on her laptop, and we watch tv together. Iâ€™m only home on weekends, so our time together is short. I need to clarify the sitting in the chair: When I used to come home, I would be absolutely exhausted from travelling and being gone all week that I was enjoying just being home. She used to try and get us out of the house all the time and that was nice. I was grumpy a lot cause of my exhaustion, so she stopped doing that, which I understand, and is my fault. So now when Iâ€™m home, I try my best to get us out of the house because that has now fallen onto my shoulders. Again, my fault and I deserve it. I donâ€™t want my relationship to crumble as I love my wife very much. Intimacy is hard between us, mainly because of my exhaustion. She thinks it is cause Iâ€™m not attracted to her anymore. It is the farthest thing from the truth, she blames it on her weight gain. We both have gained weight, and it doesnâ€™t matter to me, Iâ€™m not bothered by it at all. She doesnâ€™t pursue me like she used to, which is also probably my fault, which Iâ€™m not sure what I did. She thinks she needs to change herself, which I think is because I havenâ€™t changed fast enough. I try to be and do what she wants as a husband. I want to be what she imagines as the perfect spouse, but at every turn, Iâ€™m doing something wrong, or not doing something that Iâ€™m supposed to be doing. I donâ€™t know what is wrong with me, I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m too stupid, or completely naÃ¯ve to situations that I donâ€™t see what is happening until it is too late and she is having a panic attack, or thinking our relationship is hitting the rocks. She is always asking me if I cheat on her. Which is an ok question considering I travel for work, but I have not, and would never cheat on her. My life before her doesnâ€™t exist, her jealousy is so high, that she gets upset if there is any mention of any previous girl, which I donâ€™t talk about, or even think about other girls but her. She is so jealous that she did research on a past girlfriend I had, and learned all about her through searching online and finding pictures, blog posts, and many things. She would tell me things that I had no idea of that personâ€™s life. Then she would be down on herself and get depressed because this person is athletic and does other things that other guys would like. All things I didnâ€™t know about her as last contact I had with her was roughly 13 years ago. I made the mistake once when we went to Vegas together, and were watching a show, and commented that the girls in the show were attractive. This resulted in probably a two week long fight. I wasnâ€™t lusting after them, I wasnâ€™t WANTING them, I said they were attractive. We almost divorced over the ordeal. She comments on actors she finds attractive, but itâ€™s ok cause she says she wouldnâ€™t sleep with them if she ever go the chance. I donâ€™t feel Iâ€™m 100% at fault for everything. I do feel that I could be a better husband. I just feel nothing I do is ever good enough though. Iâ€™ve tried, and tried, and tried to change myself, to make myself better for what she has wanted. A lot of the changes were things that everyone should be able to do, we have fought over communicating with each other many times, and I feel I have truly done better at that. I have changed at where I try to avoid any of my hobbies while I am home, or show any interest in anything other than her or what she is showing me. She says that I show excitement towards hobbies that she wishes she would see when I see her, or get that excited with her. Every week I rush home so I can just be near her, she doesnâ€™t see that, she only sees when I get home and Iâ€™m exhausted and Iâ€™m enjoying her company. Iâ€™m home, comfortable, and feel like my mind can rest and wander. Itâ€™s the only chance I get to relax as Iâ€™m always on the go and am working while Iâ€™m gone, itâ€™s exhausting. I want to kill myself but Iâ€™m too big of a coward and afraid of the pain. I donâ€™t want to say anything to anyone because I donâ€™t want to be hospitalized. Iâ€™m tired of the stress that gets thrown on me with the expectations, and fighting, and feeling like Iâ€™m doing something wrong or that Iâ€™m not good enough, or that Iâ€™m not showing her properly that I love her. I canâ€™t tell her when things are wrong. She says she wants to know when something is wrong so she can fix it, but anytime Iâ€™ve brought anything up, or something that was bothering me, it blows up in my face cause I didnâ€™t say something sooner, or she totally shuts down. I have to be the constant go happy face in the family, and if I stray from that at all, Iâ€™m grumpy, mean, or a bother to be around. I was always told I would be a failure. I grew up being told I would be a failure. Well, Iâ€™m now 31 with an Engineering degree, so take that mom and dad, and yet, I feel Iâ€™m still a failure. I donâ€™t know if anyone will ever read this, or if Iâ€™m doing this just for myself. I donâ€™t know, at this point it is long winded. Iâ€™m sure if someone read it, I would be considered weak or just flat out being a baby over all this. It has gotten to the point where the stress is causing my heart to race every night, which is uncomfortable due to my high blood pressure. On that note, I donâ€™t care though, I would welcome a heart attack at this point because it would be out of my control. I just want to die.@@1
142@@ I'm 22, 23 in less than a month. I don't have a job, I haven't had a job in almost 2 years regardless of how many interviews I've had. I had an Interview recently that I was really excited about but they never got back to me even after the guy that interviewed me seemed really positive towards me, didn't even get a ""Sorry you haven't got the job Anyway, I'm in the UK and currently on Jobseekers allowance, of which, my local council are taking Â£20 a fortnight from for god knows why, So I'm getting Â£95 a fortnight. Â£190 a month, I have to pay my mother Â£50 a month for rent and my phone bill is Â£45, soon going up to Â£50 for unknown reasons. All of the money I have left is spent going to the jobcentre, job interviews, clothes for interviews, or at the weekend I'll get on a bus to see my partner who lives 30 miles away. I want to go back to college this year to do an access course to go to Uni, but even if I get the funding, I won't be able to go because I still need money to pay my phone bill and my mum her rent. If I get a weekend job that means I will never get to see my partner, and right now, he's the only person in my life that keeps me from doing stupid things. So basically what i'm trying to say is that the thought of getting nowhere in life pains me more than the thought of death@@1
143@@ Nobody understands my problem. My problem is out of the world. I suffer some spiritual and mental harrassament every second. It is beyond bearable. I am unemployed, live in total isolation without any human contact whatsoever. I had many friends, but now seeing me in trouble they all have turned their backs. Bastards. They dont give a fuck about me. It pisses me off. I have touched the bottom of depression. I dont have any damn desire. I dont have desire to wake up, to go out, to have sex or to wear clothes (I wear shitty clothes because I feel that way) or even have a desire to eat. I eat merely to stay alive. I also cannot find work because this depression gets in the way. So I have got nothing to do all day except surfing endlessly on the internet. My problem is that I can't kill time. My life is hell of boring with no drama whatsoever. I always have a peculiar hangover feeling that comes from depression. I sleep a lot or rather I should say I try to sleep a lot. I can't fall asleep without my pills. Depression has a strong grip over me. That is why I go to sleep at 7 pm and wake up at 10 am. After I wake up I start browsing on the net because I have nothing else to do. I spent last five years just sitting at home doing nothing. The city has undergone a lot of changes in five years. Traffic has increased. New buildings are going up all over the town. When I see a new building under construction I feel out of touch and old. Because the city has changed and I am the same old one. This feeling of lagging behind is unbearable. I am not on facebook, whatsapp or other social networking sites. People look at me from bottom to top when I tell them that I am not on whatsapp. When I see someone using whatsapp, it hurts me like hell. Everyone of my friends have moved on with their lives and enjoying success. I am left to suffer utter failure. I can't seem to come out of it. This agony has killed my desire to live. I have contemplated suicide many times but I dont have the necessary guts to do it. I have searched on the internet about suicide methods but they warn us about possible failure. I am afraid of what if my suicide attempt fails? It will magnify my problem. And I am also worried about life after suicide i.e. will i go to hell or will i be trapped in another limbo? I want to die painlessly and I want to die now. I am only 32 and I look at life as I still have more 30-40 years to live before i finally pass away. Living more 40 years seems like hell of a painful journey to me. I want someone else to kill me painlessly. I am even ready to pay money for that. But I guess that's not possible. If suicide is something that does not solve the problem but intensifies it after you die then I dont agree with nature's ways. It means people who want to commit suicide have no other choice than to suffer whether they commit suicide or not. Long story short, if suicide is not a option for me then I am forced to live. I dont want to get out of the house and I dont wnat live at all. Any thoughts ??@@3
144@@ I have fought a battle of unexplained debilitating physicsl symptoms for the last 3 years. Fought i mean everyday trying to fix whats wrong, get a dr to understand, miss out 0n stuff because how I feel. I was happy as can be and loved life. Lived on island with wife, enjoyed my job, lovedy outlook on life. Then suddenly i started having near syncope epidodes every do often and feelings of exhaustion. Then lead to actual synvope after exercise and pain. Went to every dr imaginable, each for 1,2,3 opinions. Even dpent a month trying to get fiagnosed at Mayo Clinic. Still no answers but dymptoms persist.  seen every psychiatrists, psychologists,  did all those 0lans, took thete meficines firmly believing i would be fixed. Told this would be temporary and would go away. I tried pushing through it, 0nly making things worse. Embarrassing myself and wife. Tried telling myself its in my head but even yhen thst dont stop me delibolitating symptoms. The told i have arrythmias but not life threatening ""yet"".  My life quality has deteriorated significantly. Ive dpent so much money on trying to find domeone, a tedt to figure out whats wrong. Taken every medicine recommended with no help. This may sound weird but im not depressed. Im depressed from feeling physically ill and dibolitated. I have snd had the world to live for. A newborn, wife, great family, financially fine. I cant find answers snd i have fought drs month sfter monyh for answers and help and they dont know. Wasted so much yime and money looking for help and sometimes still can barely breathe and severe bradycardia. I fight everyday and nothing fixes. I have no answers nor foes anyone else. Dont know where to go from here@@4
145@@ I always feel that death is not far, that at any moment I could just drop dead, and I'd be fine with that. There is nothing in my life or world that I consider worth living for. I have been like this for many years now. Life sucks and right now I am just hanging around. But a lot of times I'd choose to be dead rather than being alive.@@5
146@@ I try to make everyone smile and almost always succeed, I would make everyone I could happy. But at school, those who I made smile. Turned on me, made fun of me. Broke all of my trust. There is like only 4 I would trust but I feel that they always judge me. Even my girlfriend, I feel she is just pitying me. I hate this. Everyday. I have to go and ""smile"". Put my fucking mask on and ooooh I look happy. I'm scared of myself to be honest. I panic in the middle of classes but I am able to hide it. I avoid everyone. When I did try letting someone in, BAM they just took me apart from the inside. I now rarely speak. I hear them talking when I pass. I hate the looks they give me. I know that one day I will snap. I have snapped before but not much, but what happens? Ooh I should have walked away they would say. How am I supposed to walk away when at every fucking turn. There is another person who will talk about me. I hate all of them. Despise them. I'm also scared because I am part of cadets. I used to self harm and have relapsed. This girl at school is also part of cadets. Her mother is an officer. And I feel as though she saw my marks. She walked outside when I had my sleeves up.. I don't want this. I hate this so much. They all betrayed me, left me. Even after what I did. I hate this. I hate this. I FUCKING HATE THIS@@4
147@@ I have thought of suicide since I was small; I was born a mistake in a world obsessed with perfection. I was born to a small and unprepared family, my Mother was and still is psychitzophrenic and my Father a self proclaimed bachelor. They struggled in life with mental illness, money and probably lack of support. But they kept me unfortunately.... I often fantasize about my Mother tripping when I was inside her and accidentally killing me before I ever drew a breath. I've always had this thought lingering in the back of my mind. I grew up knowing I was different, I didn't have the same things as other kids like a family or a future and I knew that right off.... I never saw myself amounting to anything and neither did my parents. My first suicide attempt was at the age of 6, my Mother had lied to get custody of me and due to her sickness she was feeding me whip cream and living daily with her delusions. I would sleep with my dads picture under our flimsy cot and one day I threatened to do it, I remember trying. Another unfortunate event event in my life, probably one of the firsts because had I managed to do it my troubles would have been long over. My Father finally got custody of me and I thought my life would begin but as much as I love my Dad he never really stepped up.... He worked most of the time which is reasonable considering the circumstances but I was dropped at baby sitter after baby sitter to be neglected and often starved. To this day I am lucky to eat once a day and I am grateful for it. I would always try so hard to get my dads attention but to no avail, I had no siblings or friends so all I had was him and he truly was my world. My Dad began to try to rely on his sister, my aunt who had two young girls of her own so he began bringing me up to play with them but after a few years my dad was asked to stop bringing me up. Truthfully he was a single parent and didn't offer any guidance or discipline to me so that added with my crazy energy level I could always see why their picture perfect family wouldn't want us outcasts there. Needless to say this ripped me heart out as a child... I was around 12 I believe when we were cut off and their home was he closest thing I had ever known to normality so it was back to the dirt and filth of my dads apartment. Dust bunnies and toys occupied my time so I wouldn't bother my dad once he did get home to watch the game. I learned to find ways to entertain myself so I would continue with my terrible schedule of sleeping all day and up all night, this way I could hide from the life I seen passing beyond my window. I finally began making friends at school and to my dismay most of those relationships were more hurtful then anything. Soon drugs became my only solace.... To this day I burn more weed then air breathed into my lungs and at that time I also began to feel the relief from self mutilation. It was the only way to cope with the ever multiplying troubles in my life. My Dad grew further away from me and me from him, he became almost the enemy that perpetuated my miserable existence, he always shrugged off my attempts or anything he didn't like and just ignored it. To this day he still thinks I'm ""fine This couldn't be further from the truth though,now my life has become even emptier....I'm 33 with a boyfriend who claims to ""love"" me but hasn't been intimate with me in over 6 months now. Sexuality was never something easy for me as I know I am not really meant for it, I have always been ugly and no matter what I still feel this way. Being with this person only helps to solidify my belief system and I sink further into myself. My job is a joke I won't go into it for fear of further embarrassment but I can barely survive. I scrape by daily with the familiar crutch of weed to help distance me from the hard truth the my life is going nowhere and that's the best I can hope for. I truthfully am a failure and mistake, each day I live firms this belief.... I will never be whole or happy and I sleep my days away hoping that one time the suicides in my dreams will work and I will drift off into my dreamland, the only place I've ever really lived.@@2
148@@ Hey everyone, I'm going through a very hard time in my life. I have terrible social anxiety from being bullied as a child, living with my mother at 25, terrible at my job, no friends because I'm so odd, no relationship because I'm gay... and I can't get anywhere because all I want to do is fall over and die. Life sucks. I spent four years in college expecting a better life, but instead got a job that only makes me miserable because I'm just so very bad at it. To make matters worse... student debt... I'm not going anywhere in life, and I'm never going to have people in life... Because I'm just a defective human being. What's the point. I don't think I would actually kill myself as I don't believe in an afterlife. Plus the thought of an eternal void is terrifying. But the thought is always there nagging at me. I'm better off dead. I can't make it on my own. Life's beaten me. Sorry, just needed to vent.@@4
149@@ Hi, I am YungThugboat, I'm 16 years old, born and raised in Amsterdam. My life went pretty okay all up untill 2014. It all started when I got slightly sad, because of a love that didn't work out. I luckily found another girlfriend I loved very much a while after that. It was my best friends idea to try weed with me once, to fight my sadness I had. I had smoked two joints before when I was 12, but I didn't feel anything. So what we did was just smoke a few joints and that was that. But I liked it a lot. It became a habit and a habit became an addiction. I smoked about 6 joints on a regular school day and about 30-50 on some weekends. When I turned 15 I was smoking a celebratory joint for my birthday with my best friend and that is when shit started to escalate. I started to hallucinate, I felt like something was coming at me, like an oldfashioned double-decker airplane. And usually when you hallucinate your brain counter your hallucination but that can go wrong. It resulted in a disease called HPPD. A disease that causes pseudo-hallucinations and it will never go away. At the time I didn't know what was happening so I pretended like nothing happened. I continued smoking weed like how I normally did. After a while it resulted in me not feeling like things were real anymore, as if I was dreaming. I got some derealisation and psychosis with my HPPD. I went on doing drugs like nothing happened. After a while I decided to do XTC again. So I bought some pills but they had a bad stamp so they turned into powder. But I decided to take them anyway, at school. Yeah not the best idea I realise now. And then my psychosis got a lot worse. I got stuck in an XTC trip for two months, and I couldn't go to school. Luckily my girlfriend visited me very often and treated me with all love and care. When I was at home both my cat and dog which I had since birth died. When I got back to school I wasn't the same. I didn't do any drugs anymore, still don't to this day, but I was very scared, having panic attacks, and just overall heavy depression. Things went okay for a while. Untill my parents decided to divorce. Once again my girlfriend was very supportive, but I decided I didn't care anymore. Well, every time I feel suicidal, I keep daydreaming about me commiting suicide, and it's so comforting... But even more comforting is the thought about telling people the truth before I do it... you know, there are very few people I care about... But when I imagine telling the the truth, it feels... I do't really know how to describe it... Like it would realise me of huge burden...Truth about what? Well, truth about me... how I feel... Who am I actually... because no one knows me from inside... they know only what I show... and that has nothing to do with real me... and if I tell them just before I go away forever, I don't really have to deal with their reactions... I don't have to deal with the way people think about me... It seems like I haven't acomplished anything in life... everything I built, I built on lies I just want to dissapear...@@4
150@@ About month later my girlfriend left me. It was by far the worst thing that happened in my entire story. It made all of my problems worse. After four days she found another guy. It made me very angry. Being 203cm and broadly built, I decided this guy didn't have shit on me. He still decided to threaten me anyway. I decided what to do when I would run into him  and make him walk home. Unluckily I never saw him again. My ex broke of contact with me. Which made me lose all fucks to give. I started dealing, doing robberies, trading counterfeit money. But then my ex said she missed contact with me so now we have contact again but she is very dissapointed in me. My parents know about everything and want nothing to do with me anymore, they're kicking me out. This is by far the worst period of my life and I don't see it getting better with my eternal psychosis and HPPD. I really, really wanna die. I wanna buy something to use, but I'm afraid that I'll survive. But yeah, what are the odds of me surviving all this and living a life even worse. What are the odds. I really hope someone read all this, and if so, Thank you a lot. I hope you can give me insights on what I can improve in my life to prevent my death from happening. Thanks, - Sander@@4

152@@ I want to give up, I'm getting older and older sicker and sicker, My dreams will never come true, I truly hate the country I am living in and I have been here since December 2004, My family moved here and I've hated this place ever since, I can't take it anymore, I have no other family just my parents here, and I am really not getting along with them, These people from this country drove me insane depressed and ready to give up on my life, everywhere I go its the same here, people are the same, culture etc, I can't move back to the country I was raised in cause of the economic problems there, plus my depression ruined my education, So i have no real skills, I have no friends, I hate the people from here, I want to move to U.S. but that will never happen and please don't give me the ""US isn't much better"" yes it is, I have been depressed since the day I got here so that's 10 years plus suicidal since 2007 I can't take this any longer, my parents say I am a nobody which is true since I find the most simple task hard but that's cause I have no will to live anymore. I've been hurting for a decade I want to end my pain, plus cause of my depression I've developed physical problems, and now I have to take certain medicine for rest of my life which makes me bleed very easily. I never thought in a million years this will be my life, out of all countries in the world my parents choose to move here , it used to make me depressed just seeing it on TV and it's like a nightmare come true I ended up living here. I doubt anyone will even care this site has changed a lot.@@2
153@@ It's coming back strong. There is no affection in my life. Not anything from anyone. I have no friends, no mentors, no body or one. I want to die painless. I accept that I'm a coward. I'll never be able to take the plunge on my own. I have no will to become the person I want to. I don't want to keep suffering like this. Every day for a year now it's been in my head. Now it's finally becoming unbearable. I can't think about anything but what's around me. I How do some people stay happy? I'm white. I'm smart. I've got decent bone structure. But I obsess and obsess over the trivialities. All of my shortcomings take precedence. Im not cut out to be a functioning person, and I don't know what else there is.@@3
154@@ So  i don't feel seriously suicidal even though I have plans to take my life. I don't even want to really die.but if i live what do I have to look forward to. Im disabled haven't had a job a relationship i do the same thing day after day i don't have any skills on how to survive this world so when my parents die im screwed cause my siblings wont want to deal with me .something needs to change in order for me to live.i probably won't even die from the next attempt as i always seek help after ive done it i say i wont this time  but i don't know cause i get scared after an attempt. Still i feel  i have to at least try my family  is so use to me doing this it wont matter unless i die.no visitors or anything  then afterwards life will be  semi normal again unless i die then life will be terrible and ill be in hell for eternity.@@2
155@@ Hi everyone, I'm not sure how to start... so maybe I'll say something about me. I'm a 30 year old man, and I am tired of life.  I despise myself, in fact perhaps I hate myself. I got married too young to an abusive woman who hated me and cheated on me while I was in fighting in Iraq.  She would constantly put me down and pushed me to suicide, the only thing that kept me from killing myself at the time was 1. my fear of death and the afterlife and 2. my children. Unfortunately I developed PTSD, hurt one of my children, and spent four years in prison.  While in prison I tried to kill myself several times when no one was around. I always failed because in my dying state ""someone"" would tell me to stop which I obliged. Fast forward to now... I recovered from my time in prison, finishing up a degree in engineering, have a great girlfriend, and a good job but as I said I'm tired of life. I developed diabetes and I daydream of just going crazy and eating 50 Snickers, lol.  The thing is while I am not actively trying to kill myself now-a-days I am letting my diabetes kill me slowly, i.e. not taking my medication and eating like a fat pathetic felonious slob that I am. A couple weeks ago I was experiencing chest pains and was hoping for a heart attack... no luck, but the good bad news is my cholesterol is horrible and my A1C is dangerous.  the Doctors want me to start exercising and blah blah blah. So my question is why I am I so depressed to the point that I want to die?  I've been to counseling for years and the quacks can never actually fix jacked up psyche?@@3
156@@ I'm 36 right now I was born with ADHD & severe motion sickness in a lower middle class family with dominant and Bully parents, I live in a country where you don't visit a doctor until you break your leg or neck neither a doctor will take you seriously otherwise therefore my ADHD remained untreated to date, I couldn't finish my college but somehow some luck factor played its role and I got good jobs one after another therefore I had money,friends and girlfriends I wasn't very happy with my life but at least life was moving but then around 5 years ago one after another I lost everything i.e Job,Money,friends,girlfriend everything I even lost my social contacts which are crucial in getting a job in my country therefore I could have clearly predicted the beginning of a horrible end even the day I lost my Job, Now with continuous inactivity I also became pre-diabetic which is passed through my genes as well, With no hope left whenever I get a free mind suicidal thoughts capture my brain and to get away from this horrible reality While living in my mom's basement I spend whole time in front of computer watching and reading useless content and because of my computer and internet I could be able to hide from reality and prevented my suicide but I don't know for how long I would be able to delay it but I want to delay it as long as my health remains under acceptable level I'm stuck in some sort of dead end .......@@2
157@@ Hey. I've often thought about killing myself, but the thing is, I don't know why. I'm not sad, I have everything I could ask for, but I still get these feelings from time to time. It's kind of weird and the even weirder part is this: despite me not having any problems in my life at the moment, I think about suicide as if it's nothing. It doesn't freak me out, it actually makes me curious. That's so weird. I don't know if I'll ever act on these thoughts, but I just want to say that I feel very tempted for some reason. I hope you guys could perhaps point me in the right direction. Thanks for reading!@@5
158@@ Hi everybody, Basically as my title states, my life is hell. I'll try not to go on and on here but basically it's been like this for many many years. Growing up I was always bullied at school and made to feel bad and stupid by all the teachers who literally told me almost every day that I would never amount to anything. I started becoming depressed and didn't know where to turn. My parents were constantly on my back about why I was such a bad child and why I was constantly disappointing them. This went on for the whole 7 years of both high school and college (primary school was bad too but not as bad as these) and I turned to suicide. When my parents found out one day instead of compassion I got the ""why are you doing this to us?"" Anyway time went on and I went to culinary school (wanted to be a chef) but these two girls in my class decided for some reason that they didn't like me and would make the class and my life hell and they did. I found myself skipping classes and I turned to suicide yet again. During all this time my home life was anything but happy. My mother and I have never gotten along and she would tell me every opportunity she got that I was a selfish c*w and not the daughter she wanted. She even threatened to call the cops on me once. And my parents were extremely over protective even up till now (I'm 30). I wanted to move out when I was 18 and my father said if I dared pack my bags I would be cut out of the family. They would make me text (in my early 20's) every two hours where I was and what I was doing. Then anything I wanted to do it was usually a no. I was 23 and I bought tickets to go to another state and see a musician I liked and they basically forbid me to go. So I lost my money because I couldn't refund the flights and everything. I was with a guy one night and my father found out and called every person in the phone book with his surname until he found his parents and asked them to call him to tell me to call home. I was so embarrassed and of course was made to come home. This was at 26. When I went to officially quit the class the lady at reception told me that I had a nice personality and had I thought of front of house? Well next thing I know I enrolled in a Hotel School and I am off again in the hopes of getting my life going in the right direction. I fell in love with the course and front of house completely and finally felt that I had found my calling. I graduated the course and got my first job working in a hotel in Banquets. Within a couple of years I was promoted to being team leader but things were far from great. My first boss hated me and literally told me so and she once even grabbed me by the scruff of the neck, my second boss actually seemed okay but he didn't last long so next boss hit on me and when I refused him he decided from then on that he was going to make my life there... yep hell. When he moved up a position he told the new Banquet manager that I was one to watch out for and shouldn't be trusted. He even threatened me. He then told our new Food and Beverage manager and he took a sudden disliking to me to. I then got demoted due to somebody lying and saying I didn't something wrong when it was them who did it and not me. I then had to earn my position back. Soon after we got an assistant manager who tried to....force himself on me. Then pretty much it just kept going bad from there. Whilst working there I ran into an old teacher from my school who said in front of my boss that she couldn't believe that I had actually gotten a job. I felt like running away and hiding. In then end I found the boss was telling lies about me and trying to get me to break.. to snap. I was getting letters of praise from past clients and guests but I found out he was throwing them in the bin. I went to see Human Resources about my issues and then I found out that straight after our meeting he told my boss everything I had said to him and that he should ""watch out"" for me. Eventually I couldn't take it anymore and I left. I didn't get a chance to get another job because my mother was soon diagnosed with parkinsons and I had to stay home and help. This went on for 5 years with me eventually losing contact with friends and the outside world due to the fact that my mother needs full time care and she can't leave the house. Then my father got cancer and now I am the carer for both my parents. So I have been house bound for 6 years now with hardly any contact with the outside world. I have a brother who is older than me. He lives in a different country to me and he has a fancy job with a fancy pay. When he is down he tells me how screwed I am and that I have to stop being a burden to the family. I have also had (in the past) a lot of mentally and emotionally abusive relationships. Right now I see a lot of changes in my health that is freaking me out. I know some can be due to stress but its got me very scared.  I spend most of my time crying, shaking and in complete panic of my situation and my life. I haven't had a job in 6 years and the only money I get is the payouts from the government for caring for my parents which they made me jump through hoops for. It was not easy. I'm scared, I'm alone and the thoughts of suicide are coming back because once again, I feel I have no option.@@4
159@@ I went to a church this afternoon and sat crying. I went in a side chapel and there was something there which I immediately thought I could use to kill myself. I started the process but couldn't go through with it but couldn't walk away. I phoned a support helpline. I don't know how to move forward from this.@@4
160@@ I have been experiencing such an awful depression for nearly 6 years now.  Back then, I could've sworn that things would be better for me now.  I couldn't fathom living in such misery for this long.  I am a good, kind, and sensitive person, and I could not fathom a universe that would allow me to be suffering so terribly for so long.  But alas, here I am still, in the same miserable and unending depression that I was in 6 years ago and there is no light at the end of the tunnel, no solution to the source of my misery. And yeah, f**k Valentine's Day.  I haven't had a valentine in 6 years and it makes me want to vomit when I see these TV ads of attractive couples surprising each other with beautiful gifts on Valentine's Day and then kissing and embracing.  This could be me and it used to be me, but now since my outer looks have been eroded and destroyed, my hopes of finding and keeping a beautiful women are zero.  And frankly, I can't see how any woman would want to be with me anyway now.  I am a fragile and depressed shell of the energetic and vivacious man that I once was.  Life is so unfair and unjust.@@2
161@@ All I feel like doing is running away! I have been out of psyche ward for over a year, that was my fourth time. So I haven't worked for over three years. I'm in my twenty's and I now have a dead end job as my bipolar and add render my memory completely useless! But I'm intelligent, I still make stupid immature mistakes . I want to take off and travel no stress no reason just feel like escaping. I've been eating and drinking putting on weight just vegetating and wasting away in a pool of misery.@@5
162@@ I'm just out of college, in the film business--or should I say TRYING to make it in the film business. All I've ever wanted to do was write. But coming out here, the more and more I see of this shitty, shitty business, the less and less I enjoy the one thing on Earth I loved doing. Here's the thing: this isn't necessarily the reason I'm suicidal. It's more like the icing on the cake. I moved 3,000 miles from home, away from all my friends and family, for work. I thought I could handle my depression and anxiety on my own--after years of therapy in college, I finally had SOME kind of handle on things. But coming out here, it got worse, and it got worse fast. I had a low-paying, low-level job, and every day I'd have anxiety attacks. I couldn't handle it. I had to quit. I'm lonely, I'm BARELY sexually active, I feel like my career is going nowhere. What reason do I have to live? My family has no interest in helping me psychologically, I can't see my friends, I feel like I have no one to turn to. I used to have suicidal thoughts and shrug them off. But every day since I left home they get more and more vivid, and more and more convincing.@@4
163@@ My life has come to a standstill I'm so lonely it's eating away at me a little bit more every day! I really feel like ending it.@@5
164@@ I just want it all to be over.  I feel like I'm floundering at everything I try. I'm 28, single, and a teacher who used to think he was good at his job.  Now I feel like everything I do is a failure.  If I had the guts I would kill myself. I need someone to tell me I'm going to be okay. My parents have their own problems and don't really need to hear mine.  I'm so sad.@@3
165@@ ok i know my boyfriend often feel very bad at his home and wants to get away from them but he cant find a place to run off to i live a good couple of citys away from him and i dont even know his adress or a phone number of someone close to him and today he started talking about suicide and what he wants to do with his ashes and giving away/burning his belongings and that its a waste of time to stay on this earth and his thread of life is about to snap for him and how he doesnt have friends and nobody cares about him and how he takes up space in this world on one side he says that feeling will pass in a few hours and he will push it back in and on another he says all these things i cant bare talking to him right now hes that person for me. that put the beacon of happiness back into my life but nothing i say no matter how emotional makes him stop he doesnt have any friends and his family is poisonous to him me and him are that far into the relationship for me to offer him to stay at my familys house[wich even if i would they probably would say no]@@3
166@@ I attempt to talk like a human, walk like a human and love like a human. The harder I try though the less human I feel. My life is lived as a voyeur ever looking through a peep hold trying to understand what people like, how to fit in. I've spent so much time outside myself looking and judging and finding myself not fit for this life. My wife when not ordering me around likes to let me know how inept I am at doing anything while the chores and help I provide are irrelevant. I am lost, depressed and feel the urge to live becoming more and more absent in my life. I feel less in control and more like a passenger taking a ride into the night. My hear aches to be wanted and needed but I just feel more distant. If not for my kids pulling me back in once and a while, I'd have walked into the ocean a long time ago. I can't really blame all of it on my wife though. I am just tired of always being the one who has to change though, to be ordered and never touched. To feel disgusting, useless and dumb. My first post here, just getting something off my chest.@@4
167@@ What if someone is a useless individual that only takes up oxygen?  I no longer can function and I can no longer accept the illusion that things are OK or that they will improve.@@4
168@@ Hi For a while I posted here. Now I am back.  I do not feel sui all the time.  It comes and goes. But right now I am being slammed with feeling it.  Just one trigger after the next. Finally I caved.  Each time I in the past have been down for the count ( always because of something that happened) i managed to eventually get up. Even if I was down for a year. I managed to eventually get up. I am not sure this time i can. Of course each time it happens I am not sure i can.  But I have.  Eventually I have. Often it is related to reaching out for professional help and getting slammed.  Triggering again the self loathing. The old messages of not deserving.  Being too broken etc. A friend once told me that harming me is like taking candy from a baby.  And that I am such an easy target.  Its true.  Often people go into fear when they hear my more vulnerable self.  Just as they go into fear seeing a homeless person, trying to walk the other way for fear they might be contagious.  Same sort of thing, I think.  People, even some professionals go into fear when they hear my story. Because it triggers their own fears in themselves.  Then they cause harm.  And again it triggers all the old stuff.  The rejection, etc.  Its so core. Has been even as a little kid.  Often I am able to rise above it.  But I do live on disability because I am so broken and fragile. If someone is punched and down enough, I think they just want the relef that comes from death.  This is me.  This is me.  Quality of life even when I am not down for the count is not great. I do try as hard as possible.  But still.... I do ask that you try to not give advice.  Or try to solve my problems.  I look to people who know me for advice. I am just looking to be heard.  And of course to hear other people's experiences if people relate in some way to my words.  Thanks for reading.@@3
169@@ I cant live like this anymore.  Wont make it.  Need to hurt and die@@5
170@@ SO many things have come to this point, shit from when i was a kid. Things that are too hard too explain recently. I just want to push everyone away and become invisible like i never existed. I keep putting things to the back of my mind and take day by day, but I'm so confused, i don't know whats real anymore. I sit on these forums and think about posting but instead i just read things and hope that helps. I don't see anyway out of this life of mine anymore, just feels like I'm not sure whats real anymore. I act like an idiot and try to have fun but no one really knows what im feeling, and i never let them know because either i think they just care about themselves more or I don't want them to see me as weak. People expect me to be strong. I would try talking to people but i feel i already know how they will feel and what they will say and recently i came to the realization that i was right all along about how they would react. I don't know what to do anymore. I really don't even care how me not being here will affect people anymore because it's quite clear they don't really truly give a fuck about me. Sometimes i just sit there and cry by myself like a little weak basterd and i hate myself for it. I have nightmares that seem to never end, i wake up remember what i was dreaming then the day is just never the same. People say you have your good days and bad days and it will be ok . But my bad days seem like it's everyday, is it really worth living if 6 days of the week out of 7 i feel like this?. I really don't see the point. I really don't have anyone in my life and the only people i do have just seem to want to play games with me. I have a girl that i have loved my entire life, but she seems more interested in playing games than giving a shit. I hate myself for loving her too, she has broken my heart so many times but it seems like i just hang around waiting for the day she treats me like a human being and it seems to never happen. It's christmas now and i don't really have any family I just have my dog. Mostly i hang around because im worried he won't be taken care of by anyone else. I'm so pathetic and worthless. I don't even like myself so i can't even see how anyone else could. If i had a daughter i would never want her to be with someone like me. I think the whole world would be better off if i wasn't here.@@4
171@@ it was a nice lazy day.  we had a good meal.  but it was supposed to feel more, feel better, feel greater.  and work is getting busy again with stuff i don't want to do.  makes me feel like ending it.@@3
172@@ One thing I learned over all the years is that I can't talk about it with anyone. Because there's no one who will earnestly talk about it in an ""open-ended"" way, if you know what I mean. No matter who I ever talked with, they have the fundamental conviction that suicide is wrong, in the best case they lecture me why it's wrong, in the worst they threaten me with involuntary commitment. Doesn't matter that I've put years of thought and consideration into this, they keep trying the same commonplace phrases and refuse to even think about what I say. If I make a point about why I wish death over life, and why I think it's a valid stance, it's ignored and more commonplaces are thrown at me instead, because I'm wrong or not in my right mind or whatever... because my wish is principally wrong. Can't even blame them, I don't know how I would react in their situation, and I know they believe they're helping me. But for me it's embittering, and I can't help feeling disrespected. I know it's asking a lot of them to not rule out that death may be an option. But that would be necessary for any actual discussion. If my view is invalid from the start, why should I even try to talk? There can be no talking without earnest listening. Lately, they're considering if suicide might be an option for someone who's terminally ill or old, but for someone in their 30s it's still out of question. Apparently suicide is generally an invalid option for younger people, and they must be ""protected from themselves"" at all costs because it's the wrong choice no matter what. Sorry, I can't accept that. They say suicide is just running away from problems instead of solving them, and maybe it is, but putting something under a taboo is also running away from a problem instead of solving it. So how would I possibly not give up talking? I learned to keep it to myself, and isolate myself inside. That doesn't help at all, at least not if with ""help"" you mean dissuading me from suicide. They might even have influenced me away from suicide, but all they convinced me of was that I'm on my own with it, the result being the opposite of what they were trying to achieve. I made up my mind on my own then, but I'd still like to at least talk about it, and I'm tired of keeping silent and lying. But it doesn't seem as if I had much choice. I can't even really talk here, because making a point of why I prefer death to life would probably cross the border to endorsing suicide. Not even sure why I'm saying all this. Maybe just to let off some steam by writing it down, maybe asking people to listen more earnestly to thoughts of suicide. Don't know.@@3
173@@ We all go through life and become effected by different issues and the wasy we behave corresponds with these life events.  But I have had enough.  People do not live with philosophies in which we preach in life.  I constantly see sayings like life is too short do what you want or be happy in your own skin, however we cannot live with these philosophies as we constantly get judged for doing what we want.  You see constant online memes and viral photos or videos online of things which influential celebrities even laugh at and retweet or share on social media.  For example your told wear whatever you like as long as your comfortable but if someone finds it unconventional to society norms it becomes an instant source of laughter for the world on social media and various other platforms.  We cant be who we want to be say things we want to say at constant fear of the consequences.  Regardless of my views or feelings it doesn't stop the world being messed up nor does it make me wrong.  Even as I write this I am more than aware that nobody will read it nobody will care and even if someone was too read it there will be conflicting reactions and consequences which will end up people being unhappy. I do not know my reasons or maybe I do im not sure all I know is I medded a platform to express myself a wee bit@@4

180@@ I'm not sure if this is going to be very structured as my mind is all over the place with this, but i will try anyway. I have suffered from depression and self hatred for years now and i learned to live with it. That was until i met this guy and everything went away , i finally was happy with my life and i felt i belonged somewhere and that i had a purpose. Nobody could compare to him, honestly. I'm not naive to 'love' , i've had many relationships and the love i felt for him was on another scale even compared to a two year relationship i had. Everything was perfect , he is everything i would want in a partner. I lost him and i told myself at first that i would get over it. I'm not over it and i have no bad feelings towards him even though he hurt me. I was with someone else but i think i have lost the ability to feel for anyone else as nobody can compare to him, i feel no attraction for anyone else at all. If you were to ask for my one wish it would be to be with him , i honestly don't see myself finding anyone better or anyone other i would be happy with. Anyhow, after loosing him my depression hit hard straight away again , i'm really struggling to cope finding a reason to be here or a purpose. The happiest i felt was with him and i believe he is the only person that could do that to me. Therefore i do not see there is any point to life if i cannot be happy in life, if i'm not good enough for what i love , why should i bother being here? I hate myself so much for the reason he won't be with me. I need a reason to be here , i wish i was happy.@@4

183@@ I even swore to myself that 2016 was going to be 'it'. My time to shine. My time to take over the world. My time to get out there and party, meet my soulmate.. build a huge network of friends. Then again, it's Valentine's Day today.. ... there's $0 in my bank account, there's 0 new messages in my phone... except for the angry messages my boss sent me, telling me how much of a screw-up I am for letting her down. How can such a worthless piece of garbage like me possibly even come into existence? The average person would have to try reeeeeally hard to fall that low. It's too bad that buying what I would need to kill myself is so hard in this country. Maybe that's one way in which the law has actually been a success. If I had it, I would have used it. I honestly wouldn't even give a fuck about my mum's feelings, and we're almost like sisters. People sometimes do actually mistake us for sisters. All in all, I can honestly say that the reason I'm still here is the result of pathological pride. I'm depressed, but I'm reluctant to seek help. I'm lonely, but I'm reluctant to join dating sites. I'm broke, but I'm reluctant to get a job at McDonald's. I don't want to be remembered as a loser. I suppose you could say I have a strong need to be praised and acknowledged. I have insecurities. That's okay with me. We live in a capitalist, individualistic society.. what do you expect? I want to be remembered as the coolest, sexiest.. most badass fucking chick on the internet. Then I'll do it.@@3
184@@ I don't know anymore. I'm nearing my plan to kill myself soon. Very, soon. Its tough... Life is tough. And the many challanges you have to face. Its too much for me, to overwhelming. I'm not that strong, and the reasons for others are fading for me. I lost my mother to suicide... Who would've thought I would be like her? Like mothe like son, huh? In school, I'm not going anymore. Money is a struggle. Friends are barely there, with lying words they say from their fuckin' mouths. And family that talk trash about meaning of family and being and forgiving others; bullshits. Everywhere I go and look, are just lies and people that wear a mask. I'm probably no different, aren't I? I want to fix this, I wouldn't mind moving on to the future. I honestly don't. But I'm always fuckin' alone! No matter what I do to seek friendship and family, it doesn't even fuckin' matter one single bit. No matter the effort I put into it! It always fails! No matter what! And people say the common shit of finding the right people to hang with; fuck that bullshit. People, to me, are just all in the same drinking cup. Lies, lies, lies, lies,lies,lies,lies,lies,lies,lies,lies,lies,lies,  lies,lies.. and more lies. Just people that wear a fuckin' mask to gain attention and approvement from others. Pisses me off greatly. And makes me feel depress. Once the store opens up. I'm just going to go by some booze and drink for the day. And once I get my money. I'm going to commint suicide, and hopefully. Succeed this time. Unlike the other three times where I only nearly loss my life. I have had enough of this, loser, pitiful, pathetic, life of mine. I'm nobodies tool, I'm nobodies feeding object. And I'm only just a loser. A loser that's jellious of what others have around them, what they have and I don't. I'm pissed, sad, angery, jellious, envious. I'm just going to give up and throw it in. And yes. I'll be sure to leave a final message to everyone whome can read. Good bye... To my pathetic fuckin' life.@@3
185@@ Every day is just another rotation of a fucking wheel. I work out, eat well, go to therapy, and read books. I have plenty of sex, am able to be liked as a person, and have a good deal of talent. Despite all this, I am miserable. I see happiness as the contentedness one gets from willing being ignorant, and nothing else. Due to happiness not existing, I don't want to live. There is really no point.@@5
186@@ I'm not sure why I signed up here or what I hope to gain but I have an overwhelming need to get this out if only to the anonymous users of this site. I've struggled with depression all of my life. I've never felt joy or happiness as I see others do. It seems I merely exist...waiting for each day to end so the next trial can begin. I am successful, attractive, intelligent and well liked. Although it exhausts me to do so, I am very personable in social settings and can speak to most anyone about most any subject. I have tried to open up to others about my depression only to have them believe I am joking as they believe I have everything going for so how can that be possible? I've gone to therapy and have tried a multitude of anti-depressants with varying degrees of failure. The entire process of trying one after another looking for relief depressed me even more and I stopped taking them altogether. Even in therapy I never opened up about many thoughts of suicide due to being embarrassed and ashamed. I don't know how or if I would even go through with it but I've contemplated it countless times. I've gone so far as writing letters to those I love attempting to explain how I felt I just couldn't face another day. As of yet I've never actually attempted anything but as I'm now a man in his 40's I truly wonder how much longer I can continue down this path. Life is not a journey for me, it's an obstacle. No matter how many successes I have in my life I am simply numb. There is little to nothing that I look forward to and the only relief I have is sleep. I have often prayed that I not wake up from my sleep in hopes of some relief. I apologize for my long winded post. As I said, I only wanted to at least tell someone how I'm feeling. It's 6:00 pm and I'm staring at the clock in hopes it speeds up so that I can finally go to sleep and end yet another worthless day...all knowing that there's another right around the corner.@@4
187@@ Been super stressed at work and there's been that pull...that thought that I could end it and be free.  It's an almost constant thought at the back of my mind, and the method would be fairly simple. The way I've dealt with it is trying to think about my wife and what an awful person I would be to do that to her and leave her alone.  Also, been trying to downplay the stress and bullshit at work.  It's not something worth killing myself for.  In a hundred years no one's gonna care, right?@@3
188@@ This isn't strictly suicidal, I'm not going to kill myself, but it just seemed to fit best here. I'm lucky, and I know that.  I have parents who love me, teenage kids who, whilst difficult sometimes, are basically good kids.  I have a grandchild on the way (due in just over 6 weeks).  I have a job (although I hate it).  I have a loving partner (we don't live together) and loving animals, and a few friends. So, why do I spend so much time wishing I could go to sleep at night and not wake up in the morning, or that I'd slip and bump my head in the bath and drown whilst unconcious?  I find life so hard, so exhausting, a constant struggle to appear normal.  I'm just so, so tired of it all.@@5
189@@ I don't know where to turn. I'm paranoid. I have severe anxiety. I have hateful depression. I don't know why I'm like this, or what to do about it. I'm tired of living everyday as if I want to end it all. To top it off, I'm tired of living with the same stomach pain, day after day, for 8 years now. I used to think depression was bad, but by god, stomach pain, and now headaches too! I've been wanting to die for years, and this may be how I go out. Maybe I have cancer. I'm just tired. I don't know how or why this all started. And I've fought for years to cure myself of it. I've tried everything. I'm so done. God, I hate life. I hate everyone in it. Everyone is either miserable, or out for themself. I can't help anyone because I'm miserable myself. What a miserable world we live in. And those that want to help you want to charge you hundreds of thousands of dollars, like some doctors who want to run tests on me. Do I look like I live in a first world country with universal healthcare, where taxes pay for everything? I live in America, where my taxes go to rich white Republicans, to fight wars. I'm just so tired. I had a nice job once. I had a house, at 20 years old. I would say I had a wife, but nope. Not only am I severely depressed, I'm gay too. Yipee! And a pisces. An emotional, sensitive, gay Pisces, who can't handle the world. Fuck my life. I don't understand it. I don't understand why I'm here, what my purpose is, what my potential is, to do anything. I don't know what makes me happy because nothing does make me happy right now, except the comforting thought of killing myself while I'm having my daily shower thoughts. I'm just done. Every time I try to convince myself to go buy something to kill myself with, again, I have the stupid fucking fear that if I die I'll somehow be punished, even in death, because my luck in life has told me God does not give one fuck about me, so if I die, I'm to continue being punished. I don't understand my thinking. I don't understand my beliefs. These thoughts just come and go. I have dreams of having a good life, but I don't do anything to act on them. I finally got the courage, at 27, to finally go to the fucking gym, and get a membership. Finally. I had purchased a membership a few years ago, and used it maybe twice, in a whole year! What a waste of money. This time I went 4 days in a row, and I commited myself to a workout plan, and then MAYBE I'd be happy, because endorphins. Nope. I get an hour of sweating, lifting, and stretching done. I go home. I want to die. I don't fucking understand it. Not to mention, I finally moved into a low-income apartment all by myselfs. And guess what? I have rats and mice that live in this apartment. I'm here -- in this fucking shit hole -- in this apartment, and this is my life. And I live here, with rats, and mice, and things that carry diseases. And my stomach hurts. And my brain hurts. And I want to go walk outside, but no, it's fucking freezing because of the winter coming. And I'd like to go for a drive, to get things off my mind, but no, my car's head gasket is busted, and that's a $1000 fix, and I just paid $3000 for it used, about a year worth of saving, and now I can't afford to fix my fucking car. 2 months old. And this is my luck. And this is my day. Every fucking day. I don't understand it. I don't know where I went wrong. I don't know what else to do. No therapist has helped me, in 6 years. No drugs have helped. Vitamins. Supplement. Diets. Juices. And now, exercise. Yup. I hate my life. And I don't ever see it getting fucking better. But no matter how many times I tell myself it won't get better, I still won't go out and kill myself. I'm trapped in a world where I live in constant pain, and the reminder that I can't end it, because I'm a fucking coward. Who wrote this shit, anyway? This world? Fuck.@@4
190@@ just too much to deal with when you know that you are not normal anymore.  I miss the days when I was in school, poor....but hopeful there was a light at the end of the tunnel.  I sacrificed alot for my education.  Time,money, ....hobbies,...even potential relationships.  But what happened?  Life made the decision to destroy that.  And recent events dictate it may happen again. Why me?  Why cant I live in peace?  The only peace that will come is when I die.  And I dont have enough courage to even do that.  Just sit here and be a freaking punching bag.  That's no way to live, no way to recover, no way to want to be here anymore.@@3
191@@ I am in a room full of people. But I feel alone. I hate people. There, I said it. I absolutely hate people. I hate life. I have tried to assimilate into this cesspool known as society. But to no avail. I am absolutely sickened to go through this fucking roller coaster of emotions. Men. I hate them. Military men. I definitely hate them. You mentally fucked someone who certainly did not deserve it. I believe I am a sociopath. I will laugh in your face. I once wished to die. I did not want to commit suicide. But that has changed. I am taking these fucking meds, and they are making me more despondent. I hate couples. I hate watching them hug and kiss. I hate children. They are constant fucking reminders of the shitty childhood I had. No friends. Constant uprooting. Talkative in class. Duh, you motherfucking teachers. Of course I was talkative in class. I had no one at home to talk to. I ""survived"" these past 30 years. I have an education. I am independent. I have a stable job. I pay my bills. I have never been to jail. And yet, I am fucked up from a social perspective. I want to have friends. I want to go out. But it is hard when you do not have the support. I am slowly transcending into absolute madness. I want out of this world every day. Some days, I have brief moments where I want to live. But when I see couples. Children. Happiness. Friends. Things that I have never experienced (and perhaps, never will). If I had a wish, it would be for a friend. A simple wish in theory. But an impossible task to accomplish. Society shuns me. I am ignored, except when I am needed for something. But then, I am ousted back into the shadows of obscurity. Never to be seen...unless for someone else's convenience. I hate my parents. Stupid fuckers. If I knew the hellish existence I would be living, I would have told the fuckers not to conceive me. I could win the Nobel Peace Prize, find the cure for cancer, but those accomplishments mean absolute shit when no one cares enough to genuinely find out how my day was. It is unfortunate that you are invisible to people, that your pain is not unheard... I need help, motherfuckers. Someone to listen to what the fuck I have to say. I am a people pleaser. I will drink alcohol and smoke (even though I do not partake in those destructive activities) just to fit in and be cool with other people. I will risk being raped, just to gain a man's attention. I do not trust myself for that very reason. Because I will definitely cave into peer pressure. Just to have a friend. I have no friends. God is definitely not my friend. Take (my) life. It is not worth it. When I find someone I like (several times), I am rejected. Constantly. Whores and gold diggers get the man that I want. And yet, the independent and educated woman that I am finishes last. What the fuck? Do not fucking tell me that you want a woman that does not play mind games and then reject me. Fucking losers. I hope the women who have gives you a venereal disease. When a married AF person (who does not tell he is married) strings you along for three years, and he suddenly dumps you without reason to return to his n*{#@OI wife and kids, that was the last straw. But back to me. Since I cannot vent how I feel in person, I figured this was in the only way in which to state how I feel. Right now, I am in a state of frustration, sadness, anger. I want to die.@@3
192@@ For reasons that are for most people kinda ""duh"" I haven't gone through with killing myself though I have tried and obviously failed on multiple occasions since I was 16 I am now 33. It is very difficult for me to not ""do it"" again to just finally end all of it for me.@@2
193@@ I have wasted more than 30 years in search for a reason to live, but have lived enough only to be hurt, blamed and failed all through sometimes I would rather feel its better if were in coma or an incurable medical disorder wherein I can atleast sleep in peace (if not rest in peace). For all those people who wanna live and do/did convince me to live, it boils down to the last no matter how hard u try to convince, I still cant find a reason to live ? or is it really worth living this life ? In the end, I wish I could trade my life with any of those who have lost their loved ones with God, who better know the value of lives than me for sure.@@2
194@@ I been having thoughts for  some time now. I broke down several times and told my husband.  I don't think he's been catching on lately my words when I say, ""I'm tired of dealing with this depression."" ""I'm tired of seeking help for this."" ""I'm tired of endless counseling sessions."" ""Endless  meds."" Etc. He thinks there will be a break through. Honestly, I have no clue.  I hope but is this hope false hope? I just don't know anymore.  I'm just exhausted in fighting and dealing with this ...@@5
195@@ Hello All: Some have seen my previous posts about my circumstances. Well current state of affairs is that my roommate tried to kill herself last week. So it has been rough. I am also having suicidal thoughts. I just found out today that I have idiopathic edema and there is nothing I can do for my swollen legs. This makes condition number 6 that has no cure. I just want to die. I hate this life and everything in it. I am so angry, sad, and of course depressed. There is no solution to my medical problems.@@4
196@@ So irritable....so exhausted..... Just want peace... tired of being this way.... still having thoughts... when will this end???@@5
197@@ I might as well write a novel -.- please read all please take your time and read my story I'm posting because I have no where to turn to and I don't believe in ""hotline"" that's all BS, please I don't know how this happens but I met the love of my life that It was November 2011. We got along as if we already new each other from another life. Little did I know at this time I had gotten pregnant, maybe within 2-4 weeks of knowing him. I myself never loved anything more than children but I couldn't believe it was real, I didn't feel real. I used to say I would NEVER have an abortion. I couldn't. Ever see myself do something that cold hearted and inhuman All I saw was My father worked sooo hard to move us here Canada I came to be successful here I didn't even think of anyone else but myself and my father. I don't know why. I only knew that my father had mistreated my elder sister for having gotten pregnant at 21 he didn't talk to her for 6 months. Which now I wouldn't even care about. But then I didn't even know this person I was so paranoid. I crawled up into a small dark ball of sadness. As he was asking me if I wouldn't wanna keep the child. All the arguments started. I thought my dad will hate me if I keep it. I forgot about my mother completely. I thought God will hate me if I lose the child. I thought I couldn't live without being sure that the guy will stay with me to raise the baby. I thought I couldn't stop smoking so I'm harming the child from the beginning, that I didn't deserve to be a mother. By this time my self esteem was if you can imagine lower than 0. I distanced myself more and more from him without even wanting to. I compare myself with everyone. Stupid me. Didn't even see my blessing in disguise. Before you know it the day came and I terminated my baby. I can not understand how a human being can just walk into a hospital and just murder their own child intentionally. I do not understand what else was going through my head. I kept saying, it's ok think of it as if it never happened and you'll be fine with gods grace give the child to him. But I don't even remember if I prayed before or right after. I can't recall quite a lot from this time. My boyfriend was there, immediately after it happened he left the building and kept walking and he just looked at me with empty eyes. It was that moment when j realized what I had just done. But still refused to give in, o thought it was the right decision. Believe it or not on and off we made it thru. 4 years after this abortion. We moved in 6 months after the abortion. We moved into 2 several places. He even proposed to me. 2nd blessing in disguise. I didn't even realize this either. We kept arguing over the smallest issues. Both of us had so much resentment against one another. Him ok, because eof what I did to our baby. But me? What real reason did I have? Except the fact that I kept lying to myself. Kept accusing him for my pain. My pain that was cause by ME! Me alone! Not God. Not my boyfriend. Not my father. Only me! My boyfriend does have a child from a previous relationship, who at that time I thought he wasn't over yet. Which is understandable because it was only about a year later that we met. But stupid young me didn't get anything. So even tho he was and is and will always be the love of my life. I realized faaaaaar too late what I've done in the beginning. This man has actually tried everything for me regardless. Yes we also hurt each other but who doesn't accidentally once in a while. All I felt was him slipping right through my fingers and the more u wanted him to stay the more I pushed him away. Because how can one love properly when you don't even love yourself. I hate myself for what I've done. I hate my existence and feeling my own breath. I want to die because everything reminds me of the child and Him! After 4 years of non sense he left me. Because I kept leaving him for no real reason. Everything was apparently an issue for me. Because I wasn't myself. How could he know the real me if I started hating myself as soon as we got serious. Yes we had a lot of good times. But because of ME and ME ALONE, I've driven myself and him crazy. I wonder why God hasn't taken my life yet. How can one throw away so many amazing blessings along the way. Those times I felt it was dark. When i look back now there's nothing darker and more painful than life at this time. The pregnant weeks in 2012 were the only bright light. And even after I lost that. God gave me a man. A wonderful man to make my husband. I always knew myself, what j want and where I'm going. I don't know nothing anymore. I don't know how I'm still alive when I should be gone instead of my friends and my baby. My baby. I don't care what anyone says abortion should not be as simple as they make it to access. If I had more support and a good doctor maybe and most likely I could've seen myself keep it. There's not  enough reasons to not have kept my baby. I lost everything. My child. My man. My dignity. My love for life. My passion for life and love. I see that he's happy now that he's moved on after the craziness I put him through. I hate myself is an extreme understatement for how I feel. Yes I'm Christian but I believe I'm lukewarm now because my faith, oiled my own faith. How could I take gods creation and ruin it like its nothing. I want to die. Even though I know that I have already prayed for forgiveness, people keep telling me that I'm forgiven thru Jesus blood that was shed. Believe it or not I can even say I love something than its Jesus, Yahweh and my ex. But then again what is love. I don't know the feelings I've been feeling for 4 years. Day after day I have to try and just feel the pain and not give in and do something impulsive. I have built up so much anger towards myself that I have taken it out I the people I loved the most. Now I feel like everyone hates me and my negativity. I ruined my exes and my own heart. And I even blamed him. Who does that? What is wrong with me? As a Christian I'm not even supposed to put myself above gods ability to judge, it's like I'm telling God I deserve to die even if you believe I don't. I feel like I'm getting dumber by the minute and I feel that I still feel god but so distant no matter how close o try to get. I think I'm so stupid that I don't even understand God himself. Why would I deserve a life. I don't see any worth in myself, I don't understand why my abortion is supposedly forgiven (even if I don't feel it) but if I should take my own life than that's not forgiven. I'm so confused. I can't live with the pain I think I'm gonna continually be punished by the universe, God, the world whatever you wanna call it. Most of you might be thinking well those are not suicidal reasons, there's much worse. Thank you im aware and it doesn't help any more. I can't be alive if I don't love myself. God doesn't even want me not to love myself, then who am I to date ask for anyone's love and attention. I really hate my every pore I hate to feel my own skin I hate to feel my heartbeat And sometimes I'm afraid of death But when I think about it, I caused intentional death. Why shouldnt I be punished with the same. I have no reason to live after all of this and I'm praying every day that God will not hate me for what I've done, for not being grateful for life, for not wanting to try trusting him. These reasons alone make me feel worthless. I don't blame my ex for leaving me and I wanna die at the thought of another person making him happy when I took his heart and destroyed it. Why am I still here. I see humans and I don't feel like I fit in I deserve to be in prison with the other criminals. I see moms happy with their babies. Single moms. And parents. And I want to die. I can't even keep a job since this happened. I'm in a downward spiral that is too fast for me all I see is death. Please someone respond. I can't be a lukewarm Christian but somehow I want nothing more than to be accepted my god. I want to let go of this life because I can't never get back what I've broken with my own hands. The blood on my hands has not dried. And I literally feel my soul is slowly dying. At the end , God must be so disappointed that I literally don't understand anything. That I feel like I'm doing everyone a favour!@@5
198@@ I have not been feeling right ever since someone important to me passed away 8 months ago. I was not able to tell anyone, not even my closest friends or relatives, as I live in a country where marriage between our kinds were prohibited. He had been my source of inspiration, and we basically could talk about anything under the sun. He was always cheerful, and always told me to be confident in whatever I do. I always felt I was worthless until he made me see the good in me. He was from a very wealthy family and didnt look down on a person like me, unattractive, dumb and poor. He was very charming and I felt like he was an angel sent by the heavens. I always wondered what was in me that he saw, that he loved for 6 whole years. Happy moments did not last long. He was in the last stage of cancer when he was diagnosed (esophagus cancer, which had spread to the rest of his body). Weirdly, he seemed healthy the past few years. I will always remember his last smile to me before he passed, a weak smile seeming to tell me to be brave and strong. After he passed on, I couldn't concentrate on my work, and quit last May, as I did not want to affect the project deadline, and I just couldnt find a motivation to live on. I decided to commit suicide, and I found a suicide method. Last week I tried to commit suicide, but it did not work. For all of you who happen to read this, please help pray for me to leave this world. No one loves me as I am estranged from my family who think I am just worthless, no friends cos the only one love I had is no more there. Just being here in this country makes me sick as wherever I go, every scenery reminds me of the one person who has left for good.@@5
199@@ I was raised ina very christian/nice community, I was very sheltered from the world. I was always a very nice kid, I was taught that if you did good things, good things would happen to you, and if you did bad things, bad things would happen to you. My dream was to fall in love, get married and have alot of kids. When I got to 7th/8th grade I discovered the world was a very different place, people weren't nice, kids around me did bad things like curse and have sex. But they still seemed happy, I was confused, why were good things happening to all the people who bullied me. Alot of kids made fun on me. I started changing myself to fit in. When I got to high school, alot of people thought I was weird, I didn't really know about parties, drugs and I didn't drink. Alot of girls thought I was weird, I tried reading advice online about how to talk to them, I just wanted to be a good guy, I sat with a group of girls and I asked them to help me get better at talking to girls but they all got in a circle in the hall and laughed at me. That was 9 years ago, i'm 25 now. I've become a drunk due to social anxiety. I used to go to alot of clubs but I kicked out a few of them for going in drunk. I met tons of girls while drunk at bars and clubs but no real connections. Sometimes I hook up with girls from craigslist, but it brings me no happiness. I'm an athiest now, I became an athiest 8 years ago. I discovered bad things can happen to good people and good things can happen to bad people, no one in life is promised anything. I discovered love was not a fairy tale, many people in relationships are not happy, they lie and cheat. The guys I met during my life were not emotional like me, I didn't have a father so I looked up to guys who were players. I wanted to be like them, but I failed, because i'm not like them at all. I feel alone in this world, I feel like I have to lie to everyone I meet. I'm a very sensitive and emotional guy but I hide it from everyone. I feel like as a male I have to lie to everyone about who I really am, whenever i'm being myself certain people don't like me. If I can't be myself around people I might as well be dead. I want to die sometimes. Life is hard, the hard work you do doesn't always pay off. I'm a sensitive guy and i'm afraid I won't find a girl that will like a guy like me, so I drink because I hate caring, but that's who I am. I've tried to change many times, it didn't work, this is who I am. A sensitive emotional guy. I'm still the same little boy looking for my happy ending, deep down I want to find love and get married and have a family. I'm not like the other guys around me who are tough and emotionless. I went to a party with some coworkers about a month ago, and this girl I really liked came, she was also a coworker, I got really drunk and did some dumb things, and I said some stupid things to her, I can't remember but someone told me the next day. She was really nice about it but ever since then i felt like i've been in hell. I wrote a letter to her, I carry it around in my pocket everytime I work with her but i'm afraid to give it to her. I'm afraid she'll see how soft I am, But I have to give it to her. Explain to her that's not who I reaaly am, that i'm trying to be a better man. I'm going to find the girls in my life that i've been dishonest with and tell them the truth. There was another girl at work I liked, I would joke around with her alot, but today she told me that I was annoying. She's engaged anyways so it doesn't matter, not everyone is going to like me. But sometimes I feel like a loser, like I don't belong in this world and no one can understand me because no one else I know feels like dying. It's a very lonely feeling.@@2
200@@ In the middle of the night. In random moments of happy. In all hours of the day. You sometimes scream at me . The screams I can handle. Its those quiet whispers I hate the most. Those sneaky little lies you feed me, when Im least expecting it. I speak of this to barely anyone. They dont know what to say, or they say too much. I wont give in. I wont let you win. I can sometimes silence you with thoughts of my family. Thoughts of what I'd leave behind . I'd be a coward I tell myself. I'd leave a mess of my own doing, for others. But still you call me. Unrelenting , agony of a demonic breeze blowing through an other wise lovely day. Thats all i feel anymore every minute of every day. Some days its a little less intense and I delude myself into feeling ok. Then a day comes like today where its relentless, the pain takes away any ambition to do anything beyond the minimum to survive. I wonder if a day will come when the pain removes that too. Maybe its already happened.@@4
201@@ And oh, when I have a bad day, a hard day, an empty day, a lonely day, you call me even louder. Your voice is so known to me, that I almost find comfort in it. When your a little quiet, I almost worry. I hate you but It seems I also need you. to force me to evaluate, to contemplate, to push back, this dance we dance you and I.

202@@ Hi.. I am an 18 years old male struggling with depression and anxiety, but mainly severe depression. I am currently contemplating suicide but I haven't planned an exact date or anything. I am just so fucking depressed I can't find any reason to get out of bed or even open my eyes when I wake up... I don't feel that anyone really cares about me at all hell, I don't even care about me or love me or anything like that I don't feel that I am even deserving enough to post on this forum. I have felt this way my whole life but I just can't handle it anymore. I need to relieve this feeling of worthlessness. I've never had a real connection with other people outside of my family but now days I don't even talk to them. I've had a few girlfriends but they always dump me once they realize  how depressed I really am. Every day I become more detached from reality I don't even fear death I almost welcome it. I guess this is my last attempt to reach out before I do anything crazy.  right now I'm feeling very pathetic I'm holding back tears as I'm typing this. I am in a bad state of mind right now I'm so foggy I apologize for this post being so disoriented I can't think clearly anymore... Please respond whoever reads this anything will be helpful at this point.@@1
203@@ Why is it these thoughts don't go away?  I been so exhausted in dealing with this.  I'm also tired of myself.  I hate failing.  I hate that I'm always like this. I hate not doing things right.  I'm tired of messing everything up. It's like I can't get anything right. It's as though I'm failing in life anyways. Why be here? Why try? What is the point?  I just want to disappear.  Maybe be better... I just don't know anymore. ..@@3
204@@ I just need to. I need to pay for what a hurtful person I've been. I treat the ones I love like garbage and I need to stop. Why can't I just sleep forever and not be anyone's fucking problem anymore. It's horrible. I need to pay.@@2
205@@ As I write this it is a struggle through fountains of tears and I don't know if I feel this helps or not but I have had enough. I just want it to end now.  I have done everything that has been asked of me,  took everything that I have been told to take , attended every session I have been told to go to and apparently I would be cured.  I exercised got ma weight down but it wasn't enough now I have ballooned back up heavier than before and its all spiralled out of control.  I feel constantly bullied, undermined and that absolute nothing I do gets taken seriously.  It is as if I am just one big joke to everyone.  the attention seeking thing is very much what this sounds like but it's not.   I want to do something drastic and there is absolute no options left for me. For anyone else feeling like this I would say never give up, there is a place for everyone just finding it is the key.  I think I have found mine and it means I can feel free from it all eventually. I want to feel different  but the truth is I don't think I have feelings left aarrrrrgggghhh@@2
206@@ Just when I thought I made all the mistakes I could possibly make, because I knew a solution to the commitment of more - turns out, I didn't know shit! - all I managed to do was magnify the countless and unbearable tragedies of my so-called life. SO, WHAT NOW? For as long back as my mind will allow me to go, Death has been my only consistency, companion, and friend. He always soothed me with promises of peace from all my pain and struggles, on the day we would finally be joined by a kiss. I was so comforted by the mere suggestion of escape, it afforded me the strength to hold on one more day. Now that I have raised my children, I have been so anxious to meet with my long awaited friend. BUT, WHAT NOW? I have discovered Death to be a liar, and no different than the others who abandoned me without warning or explanation. When I prepared myself to be bound to only him, for all eternity, he  whispered those familiar vows. He would save me from the pain life planned to continue to terrorize me, without reprieve. Sadly, when our moment arrived, I stood alone at the altar...I had been forsaken by Death. SO, WHAT NOW? Life has never been my friend. Life hasn't even attempted to be kind; instead, life has been my biggest bully, and nemesis. He broke my every dream, squashed my few hopes, and stole my every wish for something better than my life. Even as I stood so cruelly abandoned at the altar of Death, Life was there taunting me with promises of his own -He will never let me go to be  with Death, until I have his permission. I'm afraid of the punishment Life will put upon me for not following his rules. I'm terrified, humiliated, and filled with more helplessness and anger than I have ever known. SO WHAT NOW?! I believed in Death absolutely. Nothing came close to my desires and devotion to him; Yet, in return, Death has proven me to be his ultimate fool. I made no plans for the morrow, there was no need to plan ahead. Never again would I be burdened with the toils of hurtful relationships, or worry about housing, utilities, food, and the long list of perpetual problems Life throws at everyone.Those things don't exist where Death and I would reside, so I let it all go. I choose to forsake everyone and everything, for my long awaited lover's kiss. I can't help but wonder if he is laughing at me for being so gullible and foolish. I offered him my all, in exchange he left me with only a question - one he knows I don't have any clue how to answer.....WHAT NOW?@@2
207@@ This is my first time seeking non medical aid but I thought that it couldn't hurt. I'm 24/m and the only time in my life I remember being happy, excited, motivated or even interested in waking up was when I was younger than 15. When I was young, I was good at everything. Gifted classes in school, I was on every sports team and performed exceptionally. I played competitive hockey at 5-7 nights per week for many years. I hit a point probably around 14 where everything just started to change. The flavour, novelty, and spice of life slowly seemed to disappear. I used to pride myself on my achievements and narcissist so my (thought to be) ""great intelligence"". I feel as though I peaked early and nothing since that time in my life has been the same. I developed great self-confidence issues in high school. I am overweight.  5'10"" and 185lbs - but the fat goes straight to my breasts. Yes, I do not have a belly or love handles I have man breasts.  This crushed my confidence and my life has been dominated by this for years. I try to dress to minimize the appearance. I've gone down to 165 (I'm naturally thick) with little to no change in appearance or protrusion. This self confidence issues combined with my depression lens made life terribly worse. I began to play MMORPG's with some friends, which I cannot lie, often resulted in some joy. However, joy rarely came to me as I made this video game, some thing to be enjoyed by nature into a competitive obsession. I  had nothing else to be proud of in my life so I poured myself into video games. I did this for years. I went straight out of high-school to university. I lived in campus for the first year. I went home for Christmas during break of the first year and my parents told my sister and I they  were getting a divorce. At this point, my emotions had already numbed and I knew that a divorce would happen eventually. However, it still made things worse. I soon learned about the true nature of my father, my mother, their flaws and the things to come. I never got to back home. The house I grew up in was sold after Christmas break and literally never got to back home. Five years later and no longer in University. I transferred my credits to a different college and am graduating in half a year. My image of myself is horrible and I know it is what holds me back. There are also a lot of existential crisis I face when it comes to reality, my life, suicide and emotions. I have been prescribed with a bad case of adult ADD as my brain cannot relax and stop thinking EVER. Right now I've been on your standard SSRI for about 4 years. Pretty mild dosage, but to go off it would induce horrible withdrawl. I cannot sleep because my mind races so I've been taking zopiclone to sleep for about a year now too. I've also been prescribed clonazepan for my panic attacks and extreme anxiety. At this point I just feel like a giant mess. I have almost no social life, not because I cannot obtain one but because I yield no joy when interacting with friends or others. I often find myself going to parties and wanting to leave not 20 minutes in because I'd rather be home and go to sleep. I've gotten to the point where I'd rather be alseep 100% of the time, simply because while I'm awake I have to feel this emptiness inside of me, this pain, this reminder of how useless I've become and what I think of myself. I just tried to kill myself. I had thought about doing this for a long time. I was not desperate or even sad. I contemplate suicide everyday but unfortunately where I live I have no access to what I would use. If I did I'd surely already be dead. I wrote an honest note and then made an attempt. To my dismay, I fucking woke up .. alive. I don't feel as desperate as I did before trying this, I honestly don't feel any different at all. I've been to CBT therapy for years and it yields no results. We've come to the conclusion that I need to be more outgoing, do something with my day to feel more accomplished and that baby steps will get me there. Honestly though, with the way I feel, I'd still rather be asleep 100% of the time (aka) dead. I don't want this to be my life but I don't know what to do anymore.@@2
208@@ So last time I was online I was very upset with my environment, my father was dying and I was addicted to pain killers and alcohol. Since then my dad died and I've moved out to Washington, got a job, sold everything I owned, including my car just to get there. I cleaned myself up and moved down here to be with my girlfriend. Unfortunately she was not at all what she was cracked up to be. I felt as if I was being mentally abused...there was no love I felt there. She used me for money and when I stopped dishing out, she dumped on on Xmas eve. Then I got fired on Xmas...my boss called cause I had to walk to work and I was running late. He cussed me out for the last time, I told him to f#ck off. I have no friends, no family here and my bosses and co-workers treated me like crap. So now I'm jobless and homeless and I've gotta go back to Oklahoma. I'm trying to decide whether or not I shoud kill myself. I don't know what to do anymore, so I'm asking y'all.@@2
209@@ Life is too much. The deafening silence, the lonliness. The confusion,the constant battle. The self hatred and hatred of others ..... I just don't want it anymore. Im thinking of kiling myself.@@2
210@@ I just want out! I'm tired of dealing with this. Everyone and everything want or expect something of me... Why can't everyone just leave me alone?@@4
211@@ Life for me feels just like an endless cycle of disappointment and sadness that feels like each cycle acts as quicksand pulling me deeper into despair and depression that seems impossible to get out of. Each time there is a glimmer of hope life seems to halt it and seems to shout ""f you for trying."" This has happened year after year. I have posted about my many medical issues that ""don't worry they are not fatal."" No cure type things that have deteriorated my quality of life on top of the depression I already have. I have organic depression along with medically related depression. Therapy and medications have not worked and I have had years of putting in the effort. I have no family now. I used to talk with my mother everyday however I hold so many resentments from my family that I have taken myself out of it. So I am alone. All of my dreams are extinguished within the last decade because I have spent all my time feeling hopeless in doctor's offices locally and throughout the country. I was unemployed over a year due to the stress of everything. That was NOT me. That is not who I am as a person but my job was too much given the constant pain I am in. I hate the fact that I did not choose these things. i did not choose to be born. I don't want this and I can't take this anymore. No amount of medications, psychotropic that is, is not going to work. All my different medical problems suck the life out of me. They affect different areas of my life as well that prevent a life at all really. I have been thinking of suicide since 2006. It is getting to a point where I really want that option. All the other options or the option of life I just cannot bear. I know suicide is permanent. I totally get that. I want out so badly. the responses I get are something like ""there are cures everyday."" Well I have been suffering since I was a teenager. I am now 35. If things have been getting progressively worse since then, they are not going to get better. History repeats itself. At this point I am probably rambling. I just honestly pray for the courage to make that leap someday. I have really lost one of the things holding me back which was my mother and I have cut her out of my life.@@2
212@@ I have been depressed most of my life.  My father died about 8 years ago, but he was never any good to me.  Due to circumstances, he thought - though I have taken tests to make sure this is fales - that I was not his son and treated me terribly all my life.  I am 26 now, but I have been dealing with suicide since I was 12, with most recently almost killing myself - using something that my brother wresteled from me - about 3 years ago.  This did not help growing up of course, leading to social anxiety and other things.  Well, things have been improving, as I have been working in the cooking industry for 5 years, learning things, and improving myself in that field.  I have also made some friends to help me along the way.  I lost my job at the beginning of august, but that was forseeable because the owner was selling the place.  I got a new job finally 2 months later, but it had taken a financial toll on me.  Luckily the new job payed well and I was on my way to a better living, even in line for a management position after just 2 months of cooking there.  Everything was going well until I got injured.  I had a surgery back in 2007, where I dislocated my knee.  The doc had to remove the floating bodies and replace the top of my tibia with a prosthetic.  One month ago, I redislocated it by simply slipping in some mud.  I disintegrated my left petelar and shattered the prosthetic.  It turns out that the prosthetic shattered and has left a ton of debris in my knee, one piece being as big as 2 cm.  The doc who did my surgery was fresh outa med school, and most orthopedics whom I have seen afterwards have commented in one way or another about how poorly done my surgery was.  The surgery I need now requires 3 different cadaver parts to fix my knee and two surgeons to work while im under.  I dont know too many details, I started zoning out.  The surgeons are optomistic, saying I should hopefully be able to ""walk without pain"" and that I will never run again.  I will also have to deal with early arthritis.  Thats the set up.  What make me feel like shit, feel spent, hopeless, abandoned, is the fact that this just ruins my life.  I built a career in cooking, and now I need to start over from the ground up.  This puts me in a very tricky position as I was already living paycheck to paycheck, and now I am just waiting on disability which I already know is not enough to keep me afloat.  On top of that, I have few friends who dont seem willing to make time for me.  It has been a month since my injury, and I have been visited twice by two friends, and met up with another friend at her place.  I met up with this person at her place, and there was also someone else I knew there, and it was on my birthday.  Now this friend I have frequently been there to help her out when she was down, but when I got there, she was busy making pies for thanksgiving, and did not spend much time with me.  Not a problem, but then her and the other decide that they would leave my crippled ass on the couch and just smoke on the patio all night.  On my fucking birthday, and this person cant make time to come hang out with me, and then abandon me when I go to her.  I have been reaching out to my friends, but frequently get no responses.  Its like they dont even care.  I am not even sure what I am doing posting here, but whatever. I am pretty sure I wont actually commit suicide because I have at least two people who care about me: my brother and my mother.  They have been taking care of me and spending time with me.  But these feelings I have of abandoment are so prevalent, I think about it all the time.  I feel spent.  I am so damn tired of thinking this way, I have been crying on and off for the last week now.  I dont even want to see those fake assholes who are supposed to be my friends.  I just dont know what to do@@2
213@@ I can slowly feel myself tipping off the edge. I've always felt through depression unworthy, like I don't belong and like I'm just not enough for anyone, but I've never before actually wanted to die. I hate myself. I sit in my room, I take photos of myself and circle parts I want to change. I can't stop it, I hate the way I look. I hate my nose, I want more prominent cheek bones, smaller lips, a more feminine face but I just can't see anything desirable or nice on me. People are nice to me about the way I look but I can tell that's all it is, people being nice. I hate my body, I have small hips that make me feel so unfeminine. I hate my entire shape. It's gotten to the point that I can change it without losing weight so I just don't eat. For example, today I've had a quarter of a sausage roll and an apple, and have trained (swimming) for 2 hours straight, run 10k and cycled. People say 'you'll kill yourself at this rate'. But is it bad that that's an okay solution for me? Is it okay that I'd rather try to do this, and maybe die, but maybe eventually feel better about myself? People think death is bad, that it's giving up. I think that death for me is just a possible end to me trying to be happy. I'd rather die than not try at all, if I don't try it will just end up in me wanting to kill myself even more as each day goes by. I don't know what to do, I'm never happy, I'm pushing away everyone in my life and can feel the last bit of happiness I have slipping through my fingers. I don't like any foods anymore and I used to love food. I have no appetite. I don't know what wrong with me. I retch when I eat bread, I can't eat eggs, I can't eat vegetables, I don't like ham, cheese, nuts, chocolate, crisps, I could go on forever. With my loss of appetite I have a loss of happiness, health and even will to live. I need help, I have no options left.@@2
214@@ Suicide season is here once again - the most depressing time of year for me. Haven't posted in this forum for a few years now. But I have to say my life has not got any better in that time, just stagnated. Still feeling suicidal everyday but feel very numb emotionally. Having problems at work yet again - it is a cycle; every job I do I have conflict with my line manager. So Christmas Eve at work was the worst so far, had a massive public argument with the manager due to some email exchanges with him regarding something trivial. After any bad event I spend the whole day ruminating about it as I can't concentrate on work, it was so bad I am still ruminating about it now. It was embarrassing when the Manager publicly berated me, now everybody thinks I am shit at my job. In addition to that I was getting angry but all my comebacks were so weak and ineffective, I looked like a complete fool when I said to him ""I don't like the tone of your emails"" as my final comeback before he left. Everybody around was looking at the drama - it was so embarrassing, and he was so good at talking and baiting me I felt like a complete idiot. At the time I was in fight mode, and high levels of stress seem to counteract my usual anxieties, but this not always a good thing as it is only later I realise how embarrassing it all was. This same manager, only a few weeks prior, gave me the worst appraisal I have ever had - it basically said I was shit at everything and did not ""engage"" with the team. So far I have refused to tell the manager anything about my personal problems though I have told HR - they want me to tell the manager, but I explicitly told them I don't want to yet they keep pushing the issue. The relationship has broken down so far that I actively seek to avoid all contact with him, any contact I have with him is negative. They have organised some meetings as soon as I come back to work between me, the line manager and his manager. I am dreading these sessions, as the line manager is going to say how shit I am, that I don't do exactly what he says, that I am combative, I am always late to work, I am not motivated, I look scruffy, that I am not a team player and how I never deliver. I'm sure he has already built a detailed case against me. I will be surprised if I am still in this job in a few months time. Every job I ever had has ended acrimoniously. I just can't seem to do anything right, I am a total fuck up . I have no close friends, even my main ""friend"" at work doesn't give a shit - when I try to message her she usually ignores most of them. When I try to talk to her about any really big problems she usually doesn't seem interested and instead is always looking around for people to say hi too in the middle of the conversation. She would never want to spend any time with me outside of work either. The other colleagues I talk too are also equally bored and always looking around, it is really obvious from their body language - I am so socially inept. I still think about killing myself many times a day - but strangely I am so used these thoughts they are just second nature. The main thing I tell myself all the time is one day I will kill myself - though the exact time, method and venue is yet to be finalised. I am growing older; I sought help from the NHS, been on the highest dosage of antidepressants, been to talking therapies face to face, tried counselling over the telephone, tried CBT but was told by the therapist it was not worth her time continuing with me, all of this has not really helped me. The medication makes me mentally numb and I spend the whole day in bed and hardly eat. The talking therapies only last 1 hour a week and had little affect on me. I don't want to live like this any more, I am miserable all the time and I am still alone (have been for my whole life). I can't make any true friends and I have never had a girlfriend. I have no motivation to even live, I am just existing on day to day basis. My finances are a mess and still living in squalid conditions. Nothing is looking promising so might as well end this cycle of perpetual misery.@@2
215@@ Fuck this whole god damn world.... narcosistic pricks, bullies, shit fuck politicians... commercialization of every damn thing is fucking up everything.... i just want to kill myself.... but i'm too god damn chicken shit to do it...... everyday, i just want to do it.... fuck, thousands of people die every day... why the fuck isn't it my turn yet.... fuck fuck.... selexa, lexapro, wellbrutin, zoloft, zanex..... none of it works when your destined to be fucked and miserable..... oh yeah merry fucking christma-quansa-hanuka......@@3
216@@ People do know and they are fucking NOWHERE.  They're not here to help me now.  I don't matter enough.  I'm just one more thing in the recesses of their lives.  Well soon it will be too fucking late to say crap like this.@@2
217@@ The way I think of things now is - I have two simple options, or I should say, two things I could work towards. I could either work towards some kind of nebulous state of mind where I want to die, maybe something I'd describe as happy, or I could work my way up to actually killing myself. The thing is, the answer seems so obvious to me. Option One has been attempted, and it has not worked - in fact, it might have made things significantly worse. I did go to a psych.  I don't hate, or even dislike, my therapist. I did get diagnosed with major depression. That was not new to me, I'd known for years before going. It just didn't make it better in the long run. I don't know what will work, whether it will work, how long it will take if at all. I understand why people say 'it gets better' - they are trying to help. But the is, it doesn't always. People in old age kill themselves after they've finally had enough - so maybe it will get better, maybe it won't. I, personally, don't want to suffer that long. I've already struggled since childhood. I've pursued all solutions I have the will and resources to pursue. Option Two is relatively simpler. I know dying is possible. Obviously. I know some fairly straightforward ways to achieve it. I've done pretty extensive research. I can likely better calculate the cost (in terms of finances) of killing myself as opposed to a long, unpredictable and protracted affair of 'attempting recovery' - not to mention being out of pocket is hardly going to matter once I'm dead, which has a sort of pleasing neatness to it. If I'm going to make an effort towards something, it may as well be the one with a guaranteed and predictable result - one that truly rests on my determination and little more. The reason why I haven't taken Option Two yet is simple. I'm scared. I try to practice sometimes in terms of mental preparation; I sort of go into the zone and imagine going through the motions of it all. Or I talk a long walk to potential sites, or I idly look up what I might need online. I always feel an immediate calm and relief at first - But then I'm actually there and I am Just a little more scared than I am of living out the rest of my life. The balance shifts a little every day, though. I expect - by now, I even - that someday, it'll tip, and I'll finally have a day where I face that terror and ignore it.@@1
218@@ When my wife left me back in august, my world came tumbling down. I attempted suicide when she wanted a divorce. I was a inch away from certain death.  Well since then I have been struggling with these thoughts of doing it again. I have been fighting to get the mother of my childeren back. Well come to find put she has already given her heart to someone else. Even with that, I still remain persistent in hopes she takes me back. I dont have insurance, otherwise I would definitely of already had a therapist. My life just isnt the same without the love of my life. I cant move on. Ive tried. She consumes my every thought and it destroys me. Im empty inside. I cry myself to sleep every night since we have been broken up. Our wedding anneversary is coming up, and we arent even together anymore. This is going to be the roughest times of my life. And im afraid I cant get past it.@@2
219@@ My youngest child (of 6) killed himself a year ago. I've contemplated suicide every single day since... it's an eventuality... a foregone conclusion... & like him, I'll give no signs of the imminent act nor will I leave a note explaining it.@@1

222@@ I've been severely depressed for what seems like forever now. I'm bipolar and from my birthday in October through winter is always hard, but this is different. I'm waiting for God to tell me it's time. My case manager and my therapist keep making me do verbal safety contracts with them because they know that I won't break them. I'm at the point where I don't trust them. On Friday my case manager threatened to call mobile crisis on me numerous times. I've stopped my meds because they're just letting them into my head. I don't consider them suicide attempts, but my case manager does, a little over a month ago two different days I tried to harm myself. No biggie to me. I'm horrible with waiting patiently, but I have to wait for God to tell me it's time. What should I do? I've already text my case manager this weekend and told her that God told me that all 3 of my appointments on Tuesday are just a trap and I'm not going. I just need someone to talk to. Please help.@@2

224@@ i haven't thought about suicide in a while. a long time. i don't think i've seriously seriously considered it since i was in my teens? i think...i did have a traumatic experience almost 2 years ago, i probably thought about it then too. i mean, i think about it all the time, but never this seriously. long story short, i've had depression since i can remember. i'm almost 23, female. yeah yeah, i'm young and have so much to look forward too. but honestly? i don't feel that way. if this is how my life has gone, i don't wanna be around for it to keep going this way. another 23 years of Depression sound awful. and no, i'm not motivated to make any changes. my parents have had me go to a psychiatrists since i was a teen. she gave me some antidepressants a year ago. i didn't take them regularly up until maybe a few months ago. they helped. then i stopped taking them agian. just don't get around to it. i don't have a job and i don't do anything so i don't feel the need too. i don't really have the desire to make positive changes in my life. don't care. don't like the idea of it either. i should probably say a little about myself. sorry i'm just rambling. getting everything out. i dont expect you to read everything.  i graduated college last may. theatre major. i wanted to be an actress, but i can't act. i don't express many emotions so i think that's part of the problem. i also can't write so well. maybe i can, idk. i never get around to doing much of it. i'm pretty lazy in most peoples eyes. yeah i have ADD but i also just don't do easy stuff. what else is there to know? i have no friends. maybe 1 or 2. i have a boyfriend (4 years almost) but he's not even living in the same state...the point is, we don't talk a lot or see each other a lot anymore. it's a shit situation. i've loved him for a long time, i want nothing more than for us to be together, but it seems pretty fucking impossible. i don't have a job. i had one for about a month but lost it because i can't do things right. i have no marketable skills.  i'm just depressed. i'm tired. i'm always tired.  the event i was talking about earlier...i had a medical abortion 2 years ago. that's something i never got over. terrible terrible time in my life. i'm on another forum like this one that deals with that kinda thing. but that's only a small part of why i want to die.  i have no friends, no social life. i don't put myself out there. i spend my days on the internet at my parents house. no, i dont get along with them at all. i'm a very unlikable person, and on the internet i'm truly awful.  i'm very critical of people. i guess people don't like that. sigh. idk where this is going. i'm just tired of living. i'm tired of being me and having my life. the only thing i feel bad about when i think abotu suicide is that the people who know me well will probably never be whole again. i don't love any of my family members (the only person i've ever loved is my bf)...but i still know that me killing myself would be very traumatic for them. my mom's mom apparently commited suicide (when i was a newborn). i just found that out this summer, not through my paretns. they don't know any of us kids know. so it would suck if my mom's mom and her daughter both killed themselves. but honestly, i don't blame my grandma for one second. actually i feel a little better about her early death knowing it's what she wanted. i kinda wish i could've talked to her. oh well. ok. i've lost my train of thought. typing this out has calmed me down. not forever of course. probbaly only for a couple minutes. my mind isn't racing as much. that's not to say i don't think suicide is a good option for me. i think it's really the best. i have no livelihood. no motivation. no friends. i spend my days waiting for them to be over so i can go to sleep. i spend my life waiting for it to be over.@@3
225@@ I feel so alone in this. I've lost my wife, job, license, my home and am struggling with custody for my kids. I attempted suicide 4 times in the last year. Now I'm am just struggling to put my life back together. I am slowly getting my license and my car back. I even have some retirement money coming. But all that's not important. I just want to go home to my Christian wife who said she'd never leave me no matter what. See... I was had been trying to come off drugs and was on edge. I had a nervous breakdown and threw things at her : (. That's when I was arrested. I bonded out then hit that wall. Then was arrested again for calling her and saying bye when there was a protection order. She didn't come to the hospital. I begged her in court for another chance. Just give me a year to show her that I could stay sober. Give me a year to clean myself up. Let me write to the boys and draw them pictures. The answer was no. Then she mentioned the divorce. I never cheated on her. I've given to the church. I've sponsored 4 children. I got us a house a two cars. Does any of it even matter. She promised she would never leave me no matter what. And now... I'm lost. I just want to go home. I may not be suicidal at the moment but I don't want to live. Of course I want to be there for my boys. I'm just in so much pain . Every moment is excruciating. I can't drink or anything because I am on probation.@@3
226@@ First and foremost, thank you for being a forum that actually lets people post upon joining. I attempted to join another forum that made you ""wait until an administrator approved you"", as if I was joining a country club. I need help...I'm now 23 years old and I've dealt with depression and anxiety as long as I can remember. I've always considered myself pretty ""normal"", I never went out of my way to be different like some people did when I was younger, I just always wanted to be one of the accepted ones. I feel like such a chump to admit it but the one thing I have only asked for since I was in high school was to meet somebody that cared about me. It depressed me to no end how I was always the one who was alone. I'm not conceited or arrogant, really i'm not...but I know well enough to know that i'm not unattractive....I guess i've just never been cool enough. I've dated only about 3 girls in my entire LIFE that have put me out to the curb, two of which I loved dearly and treated like queens. I'm sure I was a little bit clingy with them just because I had never had anybody who genuinely ""cared"" about me as much as I did them. The last girl I dated for 2 years almost and would have done anything for, just for her to turn around leave me like it never meant anything. I'm not the creepy type, really, i've just always been too nice for my own good. I treat them like queens only to get walked all over It's not just girls though, i get on facebook and post things; nobody cares. I try to message people once in the blue moon; nobody messages me back. It's like i'm the black sheep nobody wants to talk to. Now I live alone and am becoming a shadow of my former self. There are so many times when I want to kill myself and just end all of this, I don't know what to do anymore. The problem is, everytime I read advice from a suicide forum or ""expert"" it seems so generic ""Don't, you have so much to live for"" ""How will it affect you family?"" ""It's a permanent answer to a temporary problem"". Basically all responses that offer no help, at least for me. Can someone please give me some guidance? I can't deal with this anymore@@2
227@@ I feel like the only thing I was holding on to has just been ripped from me. I have nothing. I feel like all the warmth in my body and heart has been taken from me. I am literally cold, covered in goosebumps. I can't stop saying I want to die.@@1
228@@ For years I've been bullied. I have been fighting with my mom. The last couple of years I have just been thinking about to kill my self. But now i get bullied so much that I just want to die. I wanna kill myself.  Please help me. Im depressed all the time.. Please help me.@@2
229@@ Is there anybody on here who is near my age whose tried everything but failed? im only 19, and i already feel like my whole life has no chance. my dad was a wifebeating alcoholic and my mother was a methamphetimine addict, and i lived alone with them and constantly had to physically keep my dad from murdering my mom.. cops came so many times.. i got prescribed xanax for the ptsd and GAD resulting from my life and started abusing them when i realized that life was no longer in my control, now i suffer from drug induced scitzophrenia. i live with my grandparents, who tell me every day they dont want me here. i lost all my childhood friends because they think im crazy, i wrecked my car and got a dui sober last month, and im just so done. im either looking for someone to talk to, my age, or someone to tell me that whatever i decide to do with my life, keep it or give it back, that im not alone.@@5
230@@ Okay so I am actually sick of trying to get help. I just feel like I should kill myself because I don't know what to do about my lack of life... Sorry if this is jumbled up but Basically I don't have any friends, I live with my parents.. I don't have any acquaintances either. In fact I live in total isolation without any human contact whatsoever. I rarely talk to my parents and they don't understand me or my situation. I am stuck because I am going crazy(already have) without anyone to even talk to everyday. I also cannot find work, so there is literally nothing to do morning day and night. I sit in my room staring into space ALL MORNING, ALL AFTERNOON AND ALL NIGHT..that and browse endlessly and aimlessly on the internet. I seriously have no life, and I don't even know anyone in my town. I SPEAK ZERO WORDS A DAY to the point I get overwhelming headaches and a deep depression that lasts the entire day. On weekends I do exactly the same, and I never even leave the house because there is simply nowhere to go. I have already been through 'therapy' which lasted four years and it was pathetic and made me worse, didn't help whatsoever...tried many medications.. all made me worse.. don't want anything to do with them. All I want to do is to WORK OUT HOW TO SORT MY LIFE OUT. Not a single person has a clue and I have no idea myself. I have been to college but never made friends because of social anxiety I never spoke with anyone because I go mind-blank and cannot function around other people(due TO BAD PAST EXPERIENCES). I just don't know where to turn, or what to do. I am trying to find work but getting nowhere... but in the meantime I am going EVERY SINGLE DAY without even speaking and without human contact. I am 23 next month, and I have been like this since 17...before that my life was WORSE because I got bullied throughout the entirety of school-life simply because I was too good natured and quiet. My life is in a mess that I cannot get out of and all I can think of is suicide everyday. I have already attempted twice and been in mental hospital multiple times. What the fuck is the point continuing to exist if I just sit in my room all day everyday with nothing to do, wasting away..without anyone to even talk to. No one gives a fuck about me, and even if they did what difference would it make.. I've never had a life..friends.. never had a girlfriend.. never had sex.. never had a night out.. I literally have no life experience. WTF AM I SUPPOSED TO DO???? I cant go on like this and constantly on the verge of suicide@@1
231@@ Nobody knows that I'm being bullied and beaten at school since elementary. Nobody knows that I got molested by a relative of mine when I was a kid. Nobody knows that 'she' treated me like a slave and made me starve in exchange for education. Coming from a tropical country, I endured and survived 2 winters without winter clothes. Yet 'she' did not keep her promise, I wasn't able to finish my dream course and ended up a loser. My grand moms, they always tell me how useless I am and how I ruined my mothers dreams. My mom doesn't even react even though she's just beside me. I've been hearing those words ever since I was a kid. I'm already used to it but today I've reached my limit. I've been trying to prove myself for years. Caring for them, presenting them good grades with rewards, following their orders etc. I did not even complain even once. I'm tired, to the point that it makes me mad. I'm sorry mom for ruining your dreams I'm sorry world for being a useless scum I'm sorry that I always hurt your eyes for being ugly My ""friend"" at school even laugh at me, telling that my face is a joke. It kills me inside. Random people at the mall always gather around my lil sister, adoring her beauty same goes with my lil brother many girls fall for him. I hate to admit it but I'm jealous. It hurts to be a wild thorn in a flower. I tried suicide twice before funny it did not work. So I keep on struggling and hoping that one day I will understood the essence and purpose of life. I wake up everyday, faking a smile, faking a laugh, faking to be happy. But it seems like life can only give me pain. Life taught me a valuable lesson that being a good person doesn't pay off. I'm tired of pretending to be strong Im tired of lying to myself that I already forgave them I'm tired of lying to myself that I don't want any presents or even greetings on my birthday. I am tired of being compared I'm tired of being bullied I am tired of lying to myself that I already forgot being molested. I'm tired of faking a smile I'm tired of caring I'm tired of understanding I'm tired of this unequal treatment and pretending that I am not jealous I'm tired of being ugly I'm tired of being a good daughter I'm tired of being a good sister I'm tired of trying I'm tired of dying I just want to disappear The world is just too dazzling for someone like.@@3
232@@ it's hard@@5
233@@ Its  been a year we are together and i love him more then anything else  (expect my kids who is not with me since the brreakup with their father i  cant see them anymore) Lately i've been in dark toughts, and it got worst last week when my  uncle killed himself. It gave me the courage to do it too... But my  boyfriend is also my gardian angel. He knows i want to die, badly! He  makes everything he can to stop me or change my minds. He never give up  on me. He is the last person on earth left that care for me, but i know  my touhgts and my life makes him sad and unhappy. (just a little p.s here, english is my secondary language so please bear with me and dont judge my grammar please) I know that because of me i will never get far in life, i break all  his dream (lost the baby in the last 2 pregnancy, it would've been his  first for him and i feel guilty for lossing them even tho it was natural  and doctor dont know why i lost them :/ ) we were suppose to get  married next summer but i told him we should wait cause im scared for  our finance that we are maybe not ready for that big spending. He also  dreamed of having a good job but now that he found one, he always go to  work stressed out for me and it affect its job, once again all his dream  is shattered by me. I have no friends ... its not just a saying its a fact. we are not a  social couple we prefer staying home reading, playing cards, enjoying a  coffee and some t.v series together. So he lost some of his friend  because i always want to be with me. not that i mind but even if i push  him to do stuff with his friend he wants to be with me.  in general all his sadness and misery is caused by me. so even if i love him like crazy, i want to end my life because i  make everyone sad or angry around me. Now my love, my forst love, my  everything is sad because of me.  if i could only end it i know he will be sad for awhile but at least he  will be able to go on with is life and get further and better, happier. the problems is not that i dont have the courage to do it, that i  have it dont worry, but its the fact that i dont want him to find me,  nor to suffer too much at the beginnings. I know he will, a little while  but, how can i end it between me and life without making him too sad ? For him, and he prooved it more then once, i am the only he care about in his whole life. Nothing is more omportant then me. Some day im not always sure if i should do it or nit cause when im in  his arm its like everything will be ok, but he works a lot and when im  alone for 4-5h it comes back. The obsessif toughts of doing it. The  urgency of doing it... i think of my uncle who finally did it and  wrote to my aunt just before he did it : ''Don't worry for me, don't  cry. I am finally happy. I am finally in peace with life. I did it for  you, so you stop worrying for me and so you stop being unhappy because  of me '' i feel like i am finally ready to leave. I even helped him : i did all the  chores, packed all his things (cause we were suppose to move)  found him a job in our new town, found him a nice appartment over there  that i paid for im advance in case he had trouble with $ at the  beginnings. i paid his debt for his car and made an advanced payment on his car and his insurance. Full his car with gaz so he  will be safe to move, changed his tire chage his car oil, to  be safe and make sure i wont worry about paying for that.  evrything is ready for him to move on, i love him  more then anything thats why i want to leave him this way, so he can finally be  happy without constanlty worrying for me.@@1
234@@ I cannot fucking take anymore. Its been like this since I was a kid. Im sick of fucking trying to get answers, no one can help me. Im not extremly ugly, im not dumb, but in a positon of constant isolation no one to talk to every single day since for about years and years and years. I spend all birthdays alone. I am too depressed to be around anyone so no one would ever want to approach me. It has been too long im ready to end this now. Join a group? for fuck sake everyone says this. You cannot just walk out of total isolaiton and into a group of strangers with nothing to say.. and ive tried it. People just fucking laugh at you and talk about you to everyone else. There is no fucking point in living anymore. I am in prison basically thats exactly how it is and theres no way out. A life sentence for nothing at all. isolated childhood= isolated for every single day of your life forever. I had my birthday yesterday, sat in my room alone same as my 21st same as my 20th same as 19th. ive been trying to get help since 16yr old. im NOW 23. what the fuck.@@2
235@@ I'm 25, i have been suicidal for years but didn't want to hurt my family, the main person that talked me out of it and preached against suicide was  my grandfather, he killed himself on the morning of  19/11/2014. i am just tired i don't sleep for 90+ hours and i'm just exhausted, it really wears you down and i wasn't in a good state before. My body seems to be failing as well in the last 2 months i have had to see my psychiatrist, a cardiologist, a rheumatologist, a E-N-T specialist, a ophthalmologist and have to see a hematologist  soon. Suicide just seems like a good choice, one sad day for the family and then i can be forgotten. I am just a bit unsure, i think the thought of my consciousness simply blinking out of existence peculiar.@@2
236@@ I have been rejected several times on many online dating sites (I am a girl). I dated one person who turned out to be married and left me suddenly. I am educated, but no social circle of friends. I am feeling very hopeless that I will always be single. And right now, I have no hope. At one point, I wanted to die but wasn't suicidal. Now, I just want to kill myself and end everything. I have no friends to speak to and few family. I honestly believe this world is better without me.@@3
237@@ no point going on like this.  complete waste of time.@@2
238@@ Nothing ever gets better for me. I am so sick of living.@@2
239@@ idk what to say....don't want to be judged.  don't want the cops called.  don't want to tell my story to someone, a complete stranger.  it feels like a weak thing to do, that won't do any help whatsoever.@@2
240@@ i am a awful stupid bitch who has accomplished nothing and will never amount to anything in life i feel suicidal my mom told me she wish she had a son like my brother instead of me today that hurt........i love my dad too much to commit suicide...... that though passes my mind and has never stopped@@3
241@@ My daughter hates me. I have been suicidal for all my life, but carry on with life for my 2 kids. My daughter is now 11 and hates me. I cannot tell her off for a single thing without her flying off the handle and threatening suicide herself. I cannot cope. My son is 2 and I fear he will hate me as much when he is older and wiser to the world and how hopeless and useless person I am. I have asked for counselling but my husband refuses to pay. I don't want anti depressants as they have never worked. I feel my life is over as I only live for my kids and the one hates me and I am sure the other will too. My husband hates me too and says I am wrong. I fantasise about ending it all but have no means to do it. I have underlying Christian values (raised) and despite not being a practicing Christian still fear burning in hell. I want help but have no means (no job, no money) to get counselling myself and I am left with dealing with self hate all day. I get up out of bed because I have to. I have no desire, enjoy nothing, have no friends, no family (other than mentioned above), no hope, no will, no inspiration, no love for myself or my husband, I cannot care, I have animals and wish they will Die so I don't have to feed and stroke and take them for walks anymore. I don't want to ever answer my phone, door or leave the house. I am ugly, old, fat, mean, sad, lonely and a waste of space.@@2
242@@ Anyone ever felt what its like to deal with a sociopath!? One who lies pathologically, cheats, steals, cons, manipulates without a care!? Well I d alt with one for 6 months. From day one he lied to me saying he had been single and wanted to pursue a relationship with me. I later found out he's engaged and had been the entire time!!! All of this was a game to him but I developed genuine feelings for him. Always telling me he loved me and would never hurt me...but he did. He also has a criminal record and a string of broken relationships with women. This has really hurt me to the core and I don't know where to begin to get over it i really want to give up!!!!!!@@3
243@@ Hi. I recently read an online article about a woman who committed physician associated  suicide a few years back. She had been struggling with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis. I can relate to what she must have gone through. I mean, I don't know all the details of her story, and I wasn't living in her body. But I find myself wondering if she too got tired of fighting and gave in. Chronic physical pain. What does it leave you? worn out, wasted away. I think about how this illness has affected me so much lately too. I am looking at possibly having to go on sick leave and it's like a nightmare that I can't wake up from. Funny thing is, now that I've stopped denying what has been becoming more apparent these past few months, I don't feel as stressed out. I feel so angry about this kind of thing. We can clone sheep and print 3D running shoes and build stations on other planets, but we can't find ways to ease the suffering of people here, on this planet. Why - because there's little opportunity to profit from it? This issue also lights a fire under my ass to fight even stronger to stay alive and do the best I can - to not let the greedy pigs who are in positions of power in our world ""win"". If that is part of what stops me from taking lethal steps, so be it. To all of you who are struggling with finding reasons to stay alive tonight, maybe this is one reason for you too. Don't let the greedy corrupt win.  Have a safe night.@@4
244@@ I'm disappointed I'm posting back here again. I wanted to improve. I wanted to try to delude myself to thinking I had a chance. That I had a chance to have a normal life and to be something. But I guess I'm just cursed. I guess it's just my destiny to have a miserable life and there's nothing I can do about it except suicide and give up. Where to begin? How to start? What horrors and nightmares that I experience should I start from? Maybe life just isn't meant for everyone. Maybe this is just nature at work. Some people are winners some people are losers. That's how the way the world always worked and it always will. Some animals are weak and get eaten by the strong genetically superior animals. But hey that's life. The real world works in the same sense as in there are some people who experience nothing but suffering and misery from the moment they are born to the moment they die and there are others who literally have it all handed to them at birth and live happy prosperous lives and won't even experience one day of the suffering others do their whole lifetimes. Most people don't want to accept this reality but it is the cold hard truth and your in for a rude awakening if your not strong enough to it. Life isn't fair. Never was. Never will be. What's the real reason for this inequality? Random chance, luck, genetics, natural selection, nature. In the universe there is a basic law that seems to apply to all life. That there are winners and losers. I think this whole free will bullshit is just political correctness for the most part. The Truth is most of your life is already determined the day you are born and you have little control over it. Sure things like luck, choices, social connections can change that but not everyone has access to those resources. So why does my life suck? Here's my attempt to try to give you the whole recount of it (Disclaimer) due to the long sum of my thread I may finish my ot in different posts@@3
245@@ Three years ago, I went through my second sexual assault in my life. Ever since then, my life has been in a downward spiral. I find it hard to get the energy to get out of bed some days or even focus on any one thing, and I can't seem to get my life together. I have been suspended from school, and though I have been seeing a therapist for a while now, and though things with my school can be made better if I just do a certain things, I find it hard to be able to do those things. My grades are already poor enough that even going back to school and finishing my undergrad may not achieve anything. I am a financial burden on my parents who are at retirement age and are still working and have to worry about taking care of the rest of the family not just me. Going back to school will be expensive, and though I know my parents can afford it, it is terrible that I am a financial burden on them. My situation currently is pretty pathetic and for some reason my girlfriend is also still with me. I have no financial means other than my parents in supporting this relationship, which is now long distance, and she is miserable on the other end - with her only being able to see me every six months. I cannot seem to make her happy or my parents. My parents work so hard, and they always say that theyll finally be able to take a break once I settle down with my own career and I do not know if that is anywhere near possible. I honestly cannot help but think about ending my own life for their sakes. My parents will be able to relax as they should ( they do way more than any other parents) and take care of themselves, and my girlfriend wont be stuck in a relationship that literally also makes her stuck. I love the people in my life and I know that they love me back and I know that my death will be a loss, but after a few years as the most, wouldn't the pros of my death start far outweighing the cons?@@1
246@@ Life is ruined because of losers who made sure my self esteem went to shit. This world is fake and people are all superficial and fake. I am living proof. Everyone is a fraud and fake. Everything just amounts to chance and luck in this world and nothing more.@@5
247@@ Hi I'm turning 23 and I have this dilemma.. See I met a guy late 2014, been dating for almost a year now.. Left me twice, both times because I'm immature.. Anyways, so my initial plan was after I graduate from college, I would take up law.. But if I go with my plan, I'll surely lose this guy because he doesnt approve.. I've been putting off my law school since.. But now I'm having second thoughts because we're not exactly a happy couple? We fight a lot.. Its fucked up.. I'm now working at the company of my mother's side, but I'm not happy.. Really not happy because I still want to study.. But I dont want to lose this guy because I really really love him.. But sometimes I wonder if its worth giving up my career in law.. I know most of you if not all would think I'm crazy to give up my dreams for a guy.. But I really love him.. I know I sound stupid.. But I experience a major heartbreak in 2014 and all I can think of is I cant go through that again I might kill myself.. But now I'm also feeling like I want to kill myself that life is not worth living anymore.. This has been bothering me like forever and I'm so tired.. I want to die.. I know most people dont believe in mediums, but a lot of mediums told me that I need to study still.. Fuck my life kill me please.. I always pray to God to take me peacefully.. I dont want to live anymore I'm so tired@@3
248@@ Judging from what you've seen of me here and my previous threads do you notice anything, anything at all about me that is not right, strange, wrong or abnormal? Don't worry about hurting my feelings you are only helping me by answering honestly. I ask because if there is anything wrong about me I want to change it and live normally. Is there anything wrong with me? Am I crazy? Abnormal? Anything at all? Something I'm not doing right? Please let me know Thank you@@5
249@@ I am going to try not to write a book here, I am 34, dad of 4 kids(oldest 10)....4 years ago my wife found prescription pills(pretty much anything pain/sleeping/muscle relaxer).  She has briefly tried getting help but always has a reason.  I have long threatened to divorce her, but you know the heart is a crazy thing.  Three weeks ago my wife nearly burned the house down after prying open the safe and taking a fist full of sleeping pills(it wasn't a suicide attempt, she has a high tolerance).  I mean if everything hadn't landed the way it did, I wouldn't have my kids right  now. So I told her this is it, that I wasn't going to risk their lives further.  So here we are, she hasn't done a thing since that(sans getting more pills), I feel like I am just at my limit.  I know for a fact that if I divorce my wife that she will commit suicide if I divorce her, as if just the pain of divorcing someone you still love isn't hard enough. Beyond that my kids do not understand whats going on, so in previous issues they have all sided with my wife, and see me as the villain, as anyone with kids know they lack a filter. Yes I have spoken with my doctor about depression(not suicide thoughts), they feel that I am logically processing and dealing with extreme stress as well as one can.  I can't bring up suicide at all as it would be a determent to a case if my wife were to fight for custody(I think she will take the earlier route), which I can't let her have as she isn't fit at this point to do that.  My family is already giving all the support they can, I sadly am left with just two friends that understand and have been around, one is completely unable to understand in a normal manner emotions and issues, my other friend is more of a BS around friend(although I know he is concerned as of late of my mental state as he has asked).  I usually hide behind a thick wall of sarcasm and humor, but I can't seem to keep my thoughts away from darkness.  I think about it often, sheer will power is all that keeps me going and with my wife still doing what she is doing and the impending destruction of everything we have built over the last 15 years is horrifying.  I actually had a great grandfather and great uncle who committed suicide long before I was born, I have spent a great many hours wondering what and why.  I hope that I won't, but I want to post this, I could use some extra hope.  Everything just seems so dark. I think I failed at not writing that book...sorry about that.@@2
250@@ I wont be missed by anyone when i am gone.@@1
251@@ Thing is most people in real life act like I don't exist. Now the thing is they are doing it on purpose. They just choose not to acknowledge me. Why? I don't know. Most people here have always been hostile with me for no apparent reason. I've never really had a real friend. But why? What is it that's wrong with me? Either I get totally ignored or I get treated badly. Why does it always have to be one or the other? What could it be so wrong about me that's making this happen? When I try to attempt conversation with people here the coversations tends to be very one sided with no real apparent interest in their part. Everywhere I go nobody and I mean NOBODY EVER talks to me first. If they do their usually sales representatives or need something from me like a donation. But nobody has ever actually wanted to get to know me. It rarely happens and if it does the person will usually start ignoring me the next encounter. I can't make sense of all this. 1. I either get totally ignored 2. I either get harassed or insulted, encounter hostility 3. People who talk to me ignore me later why? Doesn't make sense??? What could it be about me that's making me alone? Could it just be the area? Or could it be me? Even strangers don't seem to want to talk to me which makes it even more baffaling. My coversations with people never go past small talk and there never is a connection. I am asking for help. Based on what you see of me here and on other threads. What do you think could be causing this? Thank you for your support and I really need help figuring this out right now@@5
252@@ I think something bad may have happened to someone I care about, but I have no way of finding out for sure just yet. I feel sick with worry and guilt that I should have done more (could I have?). Please be safe. You don't realise how much you'll be missed.@@5
253@@ I have ruined my career.  Well, I suppose there might be a chance that it isn't ruined but I'm pretty sure that it is.   I'm not even sure if I should be posting here, because I'm not suicidal because of depression, but because my career is over because of mistakes I made.  I am pretty sure I made the mistakes I did because I was depressed and I was diagnosed with depression, but I've never been entirely sure if I actually was depressed or if I was just inept at handling my life. At any rate, due to ruining my career I have reached the point where I have to kill myself.  I am afraid to do it.  Afraid it will hurt, and afraid that no one will take care of my dog.  And I'm sad that there is no hope left because I so desperately wanted there to be hope.  I had been so hopeless for so long and then things looked like they were turning around but then they didn't.   I keep trying to tell myself to stay alive and just let things play out a little bit longer just to be sure the damage is irreparable, but the anxiety of getting through each day is causing me to require an immediate escape.  I am just in so much pain.  All the time.  It never stops.  My chest constantly hurts;  I feel like I am walking around with a gaping chest wound.   I feel like I can't breathe.   Like everything is imploding. The holidays have made everything so much worse.  All the facebook messages expressing hope for the new year, meanwhile all my hope is gone.  All these normal people, with jobs and normal lives, celebrating.  Juxtaposed to me.   A total failure with nothing to hope for and nothing to celebrate.  I don't understand how I managed to mess everything up so badly.  I never wanted anything grandiose.  Just a normal life.  And for some reason, despite my best efforts, I just couldn't accomplish it.@@3
254@@ I feel like I've come to the end. How to put into words how I feel is difficult. I have left an abusive relationship, & in process of divorce. I have no money,no home, & I still have to put up with alot of his abuse. I have physical pain I deal with daily .my mother just died a few months ago & I just can't take anymore.@@1
255@@ Its been one problem after the other in my relationship. Its like my family keeps on ruining my relationship. I dont want to lose my boyfriend.. I want to die@@2
256@@ So I've been with this girl for almost 3 years now And I've fallen for her hard ! About a year ago We fell off, I started messing around with this other girl because in our first year together she was almost like a demon to me. We got back together But now she hates me for my time spent with the other girl And she says she may never be able to forgive or forget my past. I just want her back. I really can't live without her. I don't know what to do. I'm really close to ending everything I can't take this. I just want her back.@@3
257@@ You think by now, I would have learned  my lesson.  You think by now I would have changed....you think by now all the changes I have honestly made would have been enough, would fix the outcome, chose another path; done something, anything different. But alas, I am still the same person, with the same issues, with the same outcome....no matter how hard I try.  Forever the victim of my own game.  Once a chess piece upon a board of the hearts of man, once a chess piece that moved as it was told. Once a chess piece that followed all the rules, that obeyed and got nowhere.  Once a chess piece...until I broke free.  Slamming my fist into the board, declaring enough.  Going my own way.  Being ""free"".  But freedom is a reality all it's own.  Freedom is not real.  Freedom is a choice a seemingly right in our lives but is it really?  No, it's not.  We are forever on a chessboard, we are forever the pawn.  Some more than others. No matter how hard I try to move on and make better choices it always blows up in my face.  A lot of time, it is my fault and I freely admit that.  Old habits die hard.  Other times, it's really not my fault.  Sometimes it's just happenstance.  And now I am faded into someone else, someone I don't want to be but no matter how hard I try, I was forced to be. My choices and my footsteps have brought me here.  I am a victim of my own game, my own lies.  I am the one that has perpeturally waited for something more, even when I had lost all hope.  Again, my life is on a constantly loop and see the forest for the trees.  I always have, I just wanted to ignore it. I just couldn't anymore. Am I sorry?  For what?  For this life?  For this heart of mine that is unquie and doesn't understand how stop beating.  Who fault is it in the end? I do not believe in a god, nor a heaven or hell.  I believe in dark matter.  And I believe in dust. For I am dust and to dust I shall be come as the wind takes me to far away places as my soul finally finds peace in the spaces between.  I believe in dark matter.  After all, are we not matter in human form or in death?  Engery we have been told cannot be created nor destroyed.  So in this time of unbelieveanble presence....I fall into what I believe is me.  A dark hole.  A matter so dense and deep that nothing can penetrate it. For in the one moment in time, I am completely true to myself.  As I think of all I ever held dear, as I think of a world that never wanted me anyway.  As I turn my back yet again upon a world that never even gave me a chance.  To a heart that was given away to freely and didn't understand how to let go. As I watch years fade way in the form of photographs, as I watch them burn under the starlit moon, within the flames that I alight them. Who I am and who I was are not the same. I want to dream a dreamless sleep.@@2
258@@ Most people I've ever met are what I call ""filler population"".  They have been spoon fed beliefs, religion, ideas, societal norms, etc and live and die by it.  On top of that, people tend to be so selfish and are so self-involved. I've had the luck to meet some truly genuine people at different stages of my life.  Some of which, I devoted my friendship to. They made me feel special and important inside.  Eventually, time killed them or moved them away from me (I'm 29).  We rarely talk (out of sight, out of mind), and when we do, it's a quick catch-up. I want so desperately to die.  My biggest fear is that if I die, I'll have to live again on this planet, but without the experience I have now.  When I die, I want it to be on purpose, without making a mess to clean up for anyone, and then to hang in nothingness (non-existence) for eternity. In my heart of hearts, I would have done it a long time ago, if I wasn't being held back by the idea of reincarnation back to this damned world. What's the point? No one genuinely cares about me. I know if I go, my cat will be well loved and cared for. There is literally no reason to be alive, except for the idea of watching StarWars 7 or reading the next chapter of certain manga(japanese comics). Stupid stuff, like waiting to see what happens next in my favorite manga and upcoming blockbuster hits are keeping interested in being alive  ....just barely. btw, if I could have just humans wiped from planet, I would as fast as I could. Thanks for letting me vent.@@2
259@@ Some of you may remember me most will not. I haven't needed to reach out for a very long time. But without going into details my life is in shambles. I've taken hit after hit. I have nothing left to give. I can't eat, I can't sleep, i've lost a ton of weight. Ive been hurting myself. I feel I've lost someone I felt I was close too. I figure it's better off for me to just not care about them. But it still hurts to think about the end of a friendship(or whatever it is/was). I feel dead. Things that normally cause me joy can't even make me smile. I keep thinking I would be better off dead. I think about which method would be best. I don't want to live anymore. This isn't living.@@1
260@@ I don't think I'm going to last much longer. I've written letters to my roommates, parents, and a friend I've alienated letting them know that it isn't their fault, and that there was nothing they could have done to have prevented it. I know they're going to feel hurt and betrayed regardless, but I'm trying to make it as clear as possible that they're not responsible in any way. I don't know if there's anything else I can do to make it easier for them. I really don't want anyone I care about thinking that they could have done more, because they honestly couldn't have. I've been depressed and suicidal for years, but what's pushing me closer is the loss of the friend I mentioned above. I alienated her with my talk of suicide and depression, and now she wants nothing to do with me. She thinks I was trying to manipulate her, which isn't true. I feel so awful for hurting her, and I can't forgive myself.@@3
261@@ I am in my mid-twenties, grew up in an abusive home. Thought things would be better, once I fought tooth and nail to get away, but then I discovered that I'm so cold and calloused that I don't relate to people anymore, let alone let them in. Professional help doesn't serve me. Already tried that, came out worse. I've considered medication, for anxiety and depression, purely to kill my mind since I'm fighting some invisible battle. But I wonder, when the prescription runs out, or I can't afford it at some point and I'm so addicted, what I'd do then. I need to kill my mind, but medication is not full proof. I've been like this for years. No way out is certain, but I'm reaching the point where, if there was any pain, it'd only be temporary. I have a few ideas, I'm not caring about the possibility of pain anymore. So at this point, it's only a matter of when. Only posting here because I imagine some other people might feel the same.@@1
262@@ My depression first started back when I was about 11 years old, it began shortly after my mother and I became homeless and ended up moving in with a relative. During the time that I lived with my relative I ended up getting molested by an older cousin, I started to have thoughts of self-hatred and despise for myself. After living with my mom for a for awhile, I finally decided to try living with my father due to how unhappy I was at the time. That ended up being a bigger mistake, my father was never home and I ended up spending a lot of my time alone in my room. After my first year of living with my father I ended up having my first migraine due to stress and anxiety. The doctor at the time told me there was nothing that could be done to help me with the migraines, that I would just have to deal with them as they came. When I hit high school that's when my depression hit me with full force, towards the end of my freshman year my dad finally decided to take me in to see a doctor. The doctor prescribed me anti-depressant and told me that the medication he was giving me was not capable of being over-dosed on, that all it would do is make me tired if I took too many. I took that as an invite and started taking the medicine whenever I got home from school or was off from school on the weekend. After I ran out of the first prescription I never asked for it to be refilled because it didn't help and all I was doing was sleeping because of it. When I graduated out of High School I ended up reaching out to my mother for the possibility to move back in with her, which she accepted without hesitation. I was still dealing with depression but not on a major scale at the time. Things went extremely south when I hit 21, I had a good group of friends and was living alone in my own apartment. Two of my friends who were dating ended up seperating, and the girl asked me if I could house her boyfriend at my place for a little while till he could find someplace to live since she didn't want him living with her at her place. I agreed, and laid down the ground rules to him; 1. Don't eat my food without asking. 2. Don't bring people over without asking 3. He's here for 3 months and after that he can find someplace else to live. He ignored both rules almost instantly, brought over at least 3 different girls while staying with me then got them drunk and slept with them on my bed, along with eating food that was mine. Towards the end of the third month I was informed that while he was staying with me he was trying to get back together with his ex (the friend who asked if he could stay with me). I was angery with him, and ended up asking him to leave. After he left, I informed his ex that he was sleeping with other girls while staying with me. She got furious with both myself and him, and stated she never wanted to talk to either of us again. I kinda just shrugged at the time and figured that as long as she didn't get back together with him that's all that mattered.  About a month later I received a threatening message from the guy who was staying with me, stating he knew what I did and I better watch my back. I didn't pay any mind to it cause I really wasn't afraid of him. Shortly after the message my truck got vandalized, all my windows were bashed in and 'Rapist' was spray-painted along side of my truck. I was extremely confused until I found out when I informed my friend that her ex was sleeping around with other people while trying to get back with her, she decided to spread a rumor saying that I raped her. I lost all hope over everything, I felt like I couldn't trust people anymore, it really felt like she should have just killed me because the accusation that she had made of me nearly did. I ended up hiding in my apartment not talking to anyone for 4-5 months, and throughout that time my thoughts for suicide kept getting stronger and stronger until I finally attempted it. I ended up poisining myself with industrial chemicals that I used at my job, it ended up failing but not without reprecussion. I ended up getting taken away by an ambulance due to the non-stop vomitting and pain I was in, and had a MRI done to ensure I wasn't having an aneurysm due to the amount of pain I was feeling along the back of my head and neck. I never informed any of the medical staff that tended to me that it was a suicide attempt, I had them believe it was a panic/anxiety attack. When I became hospitalized my mother came and picked me up and had me move-in with her til I recovered, which I never really did. After a year or two of living with my mother again, I found a prescription to help me sleep when I had a back injury at my old job. I ended up taking all the pills and swallowing them down with alcohol. My mother the next morning literally had to shake me awake, my head was completely blurry and I couldn't keep myself from swaying. When I finally tried to stand up I found I had no strength or balance at all and stumbled across the room into the wall. It became apparent that I had done something the night before and my mom carried me to her room where she cared for me throughout the day as I continuously vomitted and blacked out. I haven't attempted suicide again since though it is constantly on my mind, like a voice in the back of my head repeating non-stop from when I am awake till I sleep. Some days it is worse than other, as of recent the thought has gotten a lot stronger and consistant. I tell myself every day I can't do it, at least not yet due to the fact that it would break my mother. Beyond my mother, there is no one else in my life that I honestly care how my death would affect them. I haven't spoken to my father in years, and I don't really have any other relatives that I am in contact with. I've hear people state things like 'Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem', 'Suicide is the cowards way out', etc. and honestly neither of those things change how I feel about it because I have dealt with it so long without relief. I saw another psychiatrist a year back or so, was given two different prescriptions for my depression which neither worked and I ended up stopping my psychiatric sessions because the psychiatrist only seemed interested in giving me meds.@@1
263@@ May or may not have explained this all too well. My life, really, the reason I want to live hangs in the balance of one person. This person, I've known him since he was 10 years old. Instantly I felt a connection with him, I wanted to protect him and keep him safe. He plays the piano, he's smart, he's not like most other people. I saw him to be something special. I knew more of him than anyone else did, after all, the distance of the internet is a fantastic shroud to enable people to do things that otherwise would be impossible. Our friendship lasted a long time after that, four years, five... Then, all of a sudden, he said something I thought I'd never hear anyone say. He said he loved me. I freaked out for a while, but gave it a chance, even though I had vowed never to get into a relationship for my sake. We've been 'together' for at least a year now. I have met him in person twice and I've never been happier. We have done things that I constantly regret, because of our limited time I think we went too fast. It's not much of an issue for him, I believe, but it is for me. Despite how well we have done together, things have taken a sour turn. He has stayed with me through one suicidal bout which lasted about five months. He's stayed with me through all those six years even though I constantly batter myself stupid with self hate and anger. It's taken its toll on him. Regardless of my best efforts to give him a break, to look out for him once in a while, it's failed miserably. The other day he told me this: ""I will look out for myself once I can stop worrying about you constantly wanting to kill yourself."" He also told me a few days before ""I don't enjoy living."" He said he didn't realise it until he thought about it, so basically he is implying that I have not even given him the chance to consider himself. The other big issue is the time difference and the amount of time he is away. Yes, I was wrong when I got angry at him for taking a play. I got mad and insulted him, hurt him, because I needed him- but when he was doing this play he wasn't back until midnight my time, sometimes later. It might seem ridiculous, but usually I can't fall asleep unless he is on call with me. We try to spend as much time talking together as we can because we both miss each other like hell. Last night I asked him to wake me up when he got back from his rehearsal, because yet again he's managed to make himself so busy that he doesn't even get a chance to come home from school until 10:00pm his time! I tried to tell him it's okay, that I was sorry for what I did before and that if he really wants to spend all the time away doing things he's more than welcome. Yes it still hurts when he's away, but I know full well it's wrong to stop people from doing things because of your own selfish needs. He didn't believe me, took it as me trying to insult him again. He didn't bother waking me until he was about to go to sleep. So I had no time to talk to him at all. He said something along the lines of ""Well you're probably happier asleep right now."" Then when he did wake me up he got upset because he thought he'd made me hate myself. He kind of had, I guess, because recently he wants to talk to me less and less... Recently he gets so stressed out when he talks to me.... And no, I'm not looking for advice on this. There is literally nothing I can do, I've tried everything. Now, when I say I can't do this anymore, it's quite simple. I have no reason to live, without this one person. Yes, terrible mistake, but that's how he managed to get me not to commit suicide last time. Put my faith in him. Terrible mistake on my part, but to be honest I haven't been living for myself for a long, long time. I don't have anything that I want, all of my dreams have been crushed. I am not the right species, the right gender, I wasn't born in the right time and now, the person I care for most in the world grows so sick and tired of me. I just wanted him safe, instead I've screwed him over. I will never have the true freedom that my mind requires. I will never achieve any of my dreams because they really were just a fantasy. I've not even managed to help anyone here. And, as soon as I've found a way to keep this one person safe, to stop him from committing suicide if I should happen to quit this life early, I think I will be going. To the next life, to the afterlife, or to oblivion. Wherever it is the mind disappears to when the body ceases functioning. No, my life is not hard but I myself have made it impossible to live. Please, for the rest of you... You can get where you want to, I know you can. Don't stop believing. I know you have the potential, so reach, reach blindly even if you're scared. Things will change. I promise. Thank you for reading. - Hayenthar@@3
264@@ A little while ago I struggled with severe depression and thoughts of suicide.  Had planned out a fool proof way so I wouldn't fail and end up severely crippled.  Came close many times.  Dad had died, dog I had since I was a teen who was one of my two best friends in the whole world passed away, wife who was my other best friend divorced me unexpectantly and a series of other things went seriously wrong. My best friend drifted away and I had no other close friends left.  Only thing that stopped me each time was I still had a very good although stressful job that paid extremely.  Thought at least that's something which I could also use to get some help and try again to make a last attempt to turn my life around.  Then I got laid off unexpectantly (never lost a job in my life before) with a deep recession and no other jobs available in my area. Now I am also unemployed, have no money and might lose my house on top of everything else that I was depressed about.  Prior to the job loss I would have been positive that this would have pushed me over.  Some how I'm still here.  I came to an important realization though.  No matter how bad things seem they can always get much worse.  Best to enjoy what you have now.  For about 5 years things in my life kept getting worse and I always kept looking back thinking how good I had it five years ago, two years ago, one year and even six months in the past.  Thinking what I wouldn't give to go back to where I was back then when at the time I was also depressed and also thinking what I wouldn't give to go back to better times. For some reason now and recently whether it be that I am in the eye of the storm or that thought that I had better savour today because it can always get much worse tommorow I feel calm and ok.  Part of me thinks so what if everything I cared about is now gone.  Life is a journey and the past was just one part of the experience with the future being another chapter in the journey of life to get to experience. I really hope that this is not just the eye of the storm.@@5
265@@ This site got me through a tough couple of months way back so would like to say thanks to all for their input. That is not the case now. Decisions have been made. Nothing can change that but if you haven't made any decisions in this regard then keep fighting. Just because one person reaches the end of the road it shouldn't inspire others to follow,use it as an abject lesson. I failed in every conceivable way you could but that is for reasons only known to me. Use this site and any other avenues to discuss your issues. DON'T give up ,unlike me you still have a chance, a chance to smile and laugh and be as happy as you want to be. So thank you TTL you delayed the inevitable and introduced me to some of the strongest people I've met. If life is like a box of chocolates then I'm cocoa intolerant x@@1

267@@ Hello, everyone.  I am a 24-year-old transman.  So, here's the thing.   Back in February, I came out as transgender, my long-time boyfriend  dumped me for another woman, and I came down with a serious, ultra-rare  brain disorder that causes incapacitating burning migraines, brain  damage, and emotional instability.  I have always suffered from bone  structure abnormalities in my legs, severe agoraphobia,  and social anxiety.  These things together made it so that I was unable  to work, and I lost my job this June.  Because of the time and money I  missed out on, I lost my home a few days before I lost my job. I stayed at shelters for a couple weeks, and I asked my dad to let me  come visit him for a week or so because shelters proved to be a  traumatic experience for me.  My dad lives with my grandma.  My dad is  an emotionally abusive alcoholic, and my grandma is an extremely devout Baptist.  He does  actually love me underneath it all, and when he managed to find out I  was living in a shelter, he decided he wasn't going to let me go back to  the town I lived in to go back to the shelter. But, what that means for me is that I'm now crashing in a very rural  town with no drivers' license (could never afford to get one, though my  driver's test's next Thursday), no car, no job, and no money.  He keeps  accusing me of being lazy because I haven't found a job, but there's no  public transport around here (there was a great system where I was  living), and there would be three people here juggling one car, so how  would I even work my availability?  I have no money to make my goals  work out, and my physical/emotional problems stop me from being able to  work the way I want to. On top of these things, I have had to hide my gender identity.  I told  my dad, who says he's supportive, but told me he would never honor my  preferred pronouns, and doesn't believe in being transgender because  ""I'm not a boy, and if I was, I would have been born with a dick"".  My  grandmother can't even stand gay people, so I know I would be disowned  if it came out that I'm a pansexual transman.  I've still been dressing  in men's clothes, but I've been misgendered and called my girl name  constantly, and I can't even begin to explain the dysphoria those things  cause.  I'm in a spot where I am about to come out to her so I can get  kicked out and walk to the city I used to live in (120 miles away)  without having to explain why I'm leaving. At first, I decided that was a bad idea because I need to figure out how  to get a car and then leave, so I can live in it away from them and not  worry about rent.  But now, I've found that I would rather just die.  I  have no money, can't work, and I am too depressed and unhappy to hang  out until I'm told I can't get disability (I don't know that, but I'm  not feeling horribly optimistic, and am unwilling to wait around long  enough to get the checks I need to get the hell out of here).  I'm tired  of abuse and unhappiness.  I have given up. I'm feeling exceptionally lonely and unimportant. I am so ready to see what lies on the other side.  As an atheist, I  can't say that there's anything, but it's got to be better than knowing  there's no future ahead of me.  I am in a spot where I'm planning the  logistics of having an unfortunate ""accident"".@@1
268@@ Iâ€™ve been thinking long and hard about situations that ive been involved with in the past. I look at my future. i used to be able to see 5 years ahead and see what iâ€™m going to doâ€¦ I cant any longer. I used to think I would always do good on this planet. Iâ€™ve nowhere near done that or even close. Ive hurt so many people. Most of them, not intentional. I look at the positives in my life. Believe me when i say, iâ€™m grateful for those opportunities and the fact that they have been there im amazed. Im amazed at the members of humanity that are actually here to help. Not the ones that arenâ€™t. I always made a promise to myself that if i ever reached the end of my tether, that id never consider taking my own life. I thought about twice. Once I attempted and it was after that moment I promised myself Iâ€™d never consider it as a viable option. I hate to say but iâ€™m on that verge again. Im sat here, alone, no one to talk to. Yet iâ€™m feeling the most horrendous pain in my body. Im numb. I had counselling today, and i all i feel now is anger towards death and society. I canâ€™t have who I want anymore. That ship has sailed. I feel like im invisible. If iâ€™m invisible then surely people wouldnâ€™t miss me. See, that to me as an analytical person is a cry for attention. Youâ€™re wrong if you think that. I donâ€™t want attention. I want to stop feeling hurt. The same as I want to stop hurting others.I used to think all the decisions i have made in my life have been right including ones that had bad consequences. However, now I look back and regret the last ten years of my life. If i could rewind it and start again knowing what i do now, i would in a heartbeat. Ive lost everything. No one respects me anymore. No one truly wants to care about me. Reading the same texts come throughâ€¦ you okayâ€¦ how are youâ€¦. yeah im good thanks how are youâ€¦. then thatâ€™s it for the rest of the day. When i was lying in the gutter on saturday before i was found. The one person that came to my aid couldnâ€™t even admit to her boyfriend that she knew me. Couldnâ€™t acknowledge that I was their friendâ€¦ Is it just something I doâ€¦ what is it about me that people donâ€™t tend to getâ€¦. Is it cause im bigâ€¦. is it cause iâ€™m average lookingâ€¦. is that it? Am i plainâ€¦ waht because i donâ€™t have a six pack half a million quid in the bank? What is it. People are happy to use me but not love meâ€¦ or choose me to have in their lifeâ€¦. Well fuck it no longer am i going to be your lackyâ€¦. i refuse to be used. Im probably the most genuine guy out there or one of a very few. If youâ€™d rather be lied to every day, then fuck off. At least i can be honest with you. Im tiredâ€¦ Im drainedâ€¦ i have no fight left. I feel like im battling some disease that is eating at me. Depression is a disease not a state of mind. Why wont you help me?@@4
269@@ so ive suffered with depression since about the age of 8. my dads an alcoholic who i had to cut off contact with about 5 years ago as he was violent. my mum moved to dubai about 3 years ago so i live with my nan. i failed in college and lost two jobs due to my depression getting in the way. I recently broke up with my boyfriend of nearly two years as he told me he didnt want my stress anymore and that he couldnt cope. every day i go to sleep wanting to die and then i wake up feeling even worse. i feel like loosing my boyfriend was the last straw. everyone leaves me because they cant handle my depressive episodes and i feel like no one will ever stick around. i feel so alone and betrayed for letting my boyfriend into my life and showing him how fucked up and alone i was, as now i feel like everyone i love i loose or end up pushing them away, so whats the point anymore, just sucks to know that i lost him because he coudnt handle being with me when i was suicidal and he thought i was fucked up for feeling that way. why do we have to loose everyone we love? i wish i knew the answer:(@@5
270@@ 21 male i have no friends, no job, nothing to do, live with parents, i spent my life soul searching trying to find a purpose and truth. Now i have fallen in the most unimaginable hell anybody could even think of. my health is failing i can't breath, walk, eat, or sleep. havnt had human contact in so long. i pray every second that ill die. I fantasies about walking outside, and going for runs since i can't anymore. But the most important thing of all is that i desperately pray for help to god, to life, to whatever there is to pray to, open to recieve whatever guidance is necessary but there is never an answer never once in my life has there even been a second of resolution. Ive done every possible thing to better my self and find resolution year after year day after day and it still gets worse. No human can help me whatever any human can do will just cause more conflict and drama.If i live in a world where i cant call upon a greater power for help than i refuse to keep going. Considering my situation i feel fully justified to take my life, its the only thing that makes any sense. posting this for no reason still alive for no reason this life is worse than any hell that anybody could imagine.@@1
271@@ First of all, I would like to start with a quick although difficult to read story. I know most people would like to jump to the end so they can reply with some helpful insight regarding suicide, but I would apreciate if you could read this beforhand. While I am not particularly old, I consider myself as such, and for whatever reason, I feel like I have already lived my life to the fullest, and wish to move on. I never had any future to begin with, as a low rank/bad chef, I never had any real expectations, and only wished to do something I liked for the time rather than studying something that could help my economic situation on the future. Never really had any set goals either, I only wished to live, get a family, play videogames and visit places. I suspect the lack of goals was the thing that set me on to the path of suicide at the age of 16. I would have went through with it if my wife (At the time just a very close friend of mine who secretely had a crush on me) hadn't stop me. Apparently finding that special someone in life can give the former a new meaning. I have everything worth living for yet my brain chemicals make me feel otherwise. I feel like a dead man walking. The only thing keeping me from ending it is the guilt on how my lover and family would suffer.@@3
272@@ We fell in love, and eventually, got married, visited many interesting places, and despite her shy personality, we met a lot of interesting people. We planned on having a family, but she was never able to have children. We decided adoption wasn't for us, and moved on to other things. We knew having a child would be a great way to make our little family happier, to fulfill our dreams, but in the end, we went against it for some reason. Saddly, things never really go right forever. Happily ever after is nothing but a fairy tale ending, and for good reason. The years passed, and eventually she fell ill. After some time, and a lot of bad diagnoses, one of her doctors diagnosed her with Cancer. The doctor gave her 4 years, and thanks to everyone's efforts, she was able to enjoy 5 instead. My whole life, was dedicated to her, and while she was severely limited because of her illness, I still tried to make her happy during those few years. The only thing really keeping me in this world, was her. Now, I feel that I have fully fulfilled my porpuse in life, something a lot of people seek, but few manage to complete. As I sit in my room, lonely, with a huge debt, and at the end of my social and working life, I wonder, why should I still go on? I asked myself this many times, and asked for help almost as much, never really finding an awnser that could satisfy me. So far, it seems the only thing people manage to tell me is to hold on for the sake of it. To gamble my way in life and hope for a better future, that based in previous experiences, seems highly unlikely, if not impossible. If the future looks nothing but gloom, and don't have anything to live for, or even look forward to, is it still wrong to do it? Haven't I earned the right? Regardless, the only thing holding me back from commiting the act is my severe lack of funds and contact, that prevent me from doing it in a painless way. I urge you to first think about this little story for a minute before replying. I would appreciate an honest answer. Thank you very much for your time.@@1
273@@ I've been lurking around the forum for some time now and there's lots of posts about how if you do the right thing you'll be OK and how good people will always triumph in the end, but what if you are not a good person? I've made some pretty stupid choices, ones that I consider to make me a bad person. Ones that have the ability to ruin my career and my relationship. I'm just waiting to see what the consequences of these decisions are now, and whether I will be able to cope and get through the other side or whether I will give up and slip into the quiet darkness of nothing. Should I just go now, because I deserve it by being a bad person?@@2
274@@ Hey... This is the third forum I'm posting this on, and all I get is people feeling sorry for me. I just want a way out of this, please, someone. So...it's 2 am now, not do I only have depression,  social anxiety and possibly aspergers, no, I also have insomnia. I'm 15 and the lats few months were hell for me. I don't have many friends, two of my best friends noved away and I don't really talk to them anymore, when I ask them if we should meet they always have 'plans'. My other 'best friend' doesn't care about me at all. She doesn't invite me to stuff, she doesn't even try to help me even though I told her I had social issues and I get picked on a lot in my grade. A week ago, at lunch break, she told me that she was going to meet up with someone else. When I told her I didn't have anyone else to hang out with, she simply said 'that's not my problem. ' I have a few other friends, but I'm really just their placeholder when they have no one else because I'm boring.  Nobody cares if I'm there or not,  nobody invites me to anything, I'm starting to br a complete outsider. Many people tell me to just make new friends, but I just can't.  I'm shy, I'm boring, I'm ugly, I have nothing to say. The boys in my class make me feel even worse, I hear them talking about how they hate me, they avoid sitting next to me etc. Not even my family cares. I hate my Sister,  she always tells me how stupid I am, my mother always yells at me because I never go out. I don't know how to tell her that I just don't have anyone. My brother was the only one I really connected with, but he moved out. I can't talk to anyone, I'm embarassed. My parents won't understand. Help me. Please.@@5
275@@ Wobbling on the edge of utter desolation, Where thoughts of death become a fascination. I take a step backwards and continue to sway, Is this the final hand that I will play? While what lays behind me is probably eternal rest, Is this decision the very best? Death is certain and that much I know, However there is still life in me left to flow. Perhaps this anguish can evolve, Maybe this question isn't impossible to solve. If I pay a visit to the abyss, There are so many things here that I will miss. Some things good and some things bad, Joyful events and those which are sad. When will this perspective shift? I desperately need my spirits to lift. I look in the mirror and remember every scar, The result of my despair I need not look far. Thoughts race through me, shackles tighten, I scream and then peculiarly my sense of awareness begins to heighten. A new thought washes through my being, I take a second glance in the mirror unsure of what I'm seeing. The burden within me feels far lighter, A winning result for this righteous fighter. The ground stops shaking and I gain some composure, Taking a step towards what was once an enclosure. Shadows fade away revealing what they left in the dark, Being pulled forward my soul begins to embark.@@3
276@@ I've been trying to express to my wife for several years how depressed I've been.  All she can do is lecture and basically tell me to go talk to someone else because ""she's not a professional"". Problem is, I've spent over 20 years in therapy, and while it did help, it has not helped me to resolve the fundamental problems I have in dealing with people.  I try so hard to please my wife, my boss and other people.  But I feel I am treated insensitively and neglected.  It really started when I was in 1st grade.  My mother tried to strangle me to death. I remember being on the black couch in the den, and her squeezing my neck. I couldn't speak, and I could remember thinking ""why is my mommy doing this to me?""  My father once started smashing my head against the concrete basement in the driveway.  My older brother stopped him. The melee went inside, and they got into a fist fight.  My father beat my brother badly.  I watched in horror as he smashed my brothers head into some heavy wood shutters.  I can still see today the blood running like rivulets down his head.  They decided they had to take him to the hospital, and they blamed me.  When my father went to take my brother to the ER, my mom kept yelling at me that my father was going to jail and it was all my fault. He didn't go to jail, just made an excuse to the doctor, which in those days you could get away with. I was threatened constantly and lived in fear.  I was picked on badly at school, and fought back against my attackers. Teachers generally hated me even though I was a good student - I really don't know why.  When I tried to protect myself, the teachers generally took the other kids side, even though I as a good student.  I've never understood why people have so little regard for me. I try to tell my wife when the stress in my life is too much, and ask her not to load me up. She doesn't seem to understand, but I know if she keeps pushing me, I will blow.  I can't talk to her about it, because she gets angry and shuts me down.  Tonight, I resolved I wasn't going to let her do that and things got ugly.  She actually grabbed the wheel and tried to crash us into a tree.  She demands I not talk to her, or she will do something. Usually she breaks and damages stuff.  Tonight she started pounding me with her fists.  When I called her on it, her response was basically ""I deserved it because I won't shut up"".  She then compared me to the loser husband of one of her friends.  This really hurt me because there is no comparison between the two of us.  She says she says this stuff to hurt me and make me shut up. I suggested we get a divorce, and she said that if I wanted one, I could do all the work.  I talked about ending it, and she told me to go ahead, but if I failed or she caught me before I could complete the act, she would call the cops and have me committed. I did almost attempt to kill myself. She feels I make idle threats. I want to end it, but I'm afraid. My mother always beat into my head that if I kill myself, I will be punished by God for my sin. Knowing my luck, I would die to release myself from pain, only to be thrust into something worse.  My job is awful. I have 2 masters degrees and work at a large university. But the people there are extremely territorial and do not respect anyone without a PhD. I don't know what to do. Honestly, if I knew there was no afterlife, or that God would not punish me, I would definitely do it.  I try to be calm and kind. But I feel like I'm in a vice all the time.  It doesn't matter what I do, eventually I will spaz out and then I'm right back in this place. I wish I could be different, that I could get people to love and really care about me, but I do not honestly believe it will happen. I was in the process of preparing lists for my wife, so she would know about the accounts, insurance, passwords and alike, but after the things she said to me tonight, I think ""fuck it"", she can fend for herself. I don't know what anyone can say at this point to help. Going back to shrinks is not the answer. I have no quality of life left, not at least psychologically or spiritually.  I don't see why people consider people like me ""insane""?  I have been abused, threatened and bullied my whole life.  People take what I offer and given nothing in return. When I really need them, they leave me hanging.  What is the point? I cannot change anything and I have really tried. I can't find someone that won't abandon me, but they always disappoint. I cannot find someone who will not treat me as just someone to do stuff for them - I'm only as good as my next ""trick"". So long as a accept whatever crap they want to give me and no more, everything is just fine. I can't do it anymore. It just isn't worth it.@@5
277@@ My life has been very shitty. All I want is a hot girl to love me but I guess that's probably never going to happen for me. Women these days are all after good-looking and rich men and if you are not rich and good-looking then you have a snowball's chance in Hell in ever getting sex and a girlfriend. I feel so ugly and worthless in that I can't get a hot girl to ever like me back. What is the point of living if you can't get affection from women.  What is the point of living if your dreams will never come true. If I was not a coward I would have committed suicide a long time ago but I'm just a coward.@@1
278@@ I donâ€˜t really know what Iâ€˜m doing here anymore. In this house... in this school... on this forum... in this world... I hate nearly everything in my life. Iâ€˜ve felt well for nearly a month. And all it took to completly fuck me up is two bad days. I know Iâ€˜m young and I have whole life ahead of me, but I donâ€˜t want that life. And Iâ€˜m not even shure I have much life ahead of me. Atleast not real life. I just made a lot of bad decisions in life. I made some very ambicious decisions. Now Iâ€˜m cracking under pressure. And even those. decisions I didnâ€˜t make because I was ambicious. I did it to impress others. And now, here I am, seeking some attention, because I canâ€˜t deal with life myself! I am pathetic@@3
279@@ Hey Where to start? Found out my wife was doing the unthinkable! Would have been sent down for life had circumstance been slightly different but well... I didn't get that chance unfortunately!  So we split, 3 kids stress and drama and all the emotions of moving out! The last 6 months have really knocked the shit outta me. Miss my family so badly it wounds me just to think about them.... But I can't ever go back.. Miss waking up with my youngest asking for his breakfast! Miss coming from work and asking how school was. Even miss my wife(god help me)  Its over, and I know it. And it depressed me to know it. Friends tell me it's all good - single life has it's merits! I'm 511 - 220 tanned, shaved head and  a weight lifter since my early teens -  I'm just into my 40s but look good for it.  But... I'm so utterly depressed I'm starting to lose it.. Alone, lost and angry! Seems like I've fallen out with everyone with this horrible anger I carry everywhere I go - even myself some days!! Everything I cared about in the world has been took from me and I can't do anything to change it! I'm a mans man. Fix anything - sort anything. I was a good family man so I thought, but I've found I'm lousy at single life. I hate it with a passion. I don't hate myself or feel I deserve death, just feel like I've had my time. Im a adult and if I decide I don't want 'this' anymore, it's my choice. Done my best and can't be arsed with picking my self of the floor daily to get on with it.  Tried slapping myself really hard!! nothing works to pull me outta this horrible low. Gym helps a little but what's the point anymore. I talk to no one and nobody about how I feel. The only person that I would ever open up to is now a ex and no longer in my phone book.  :( I'm sure I have loads to life for - one day at a time and all that. I'm not stupid or rash...but that tree on the way to work in the morning has my name (and car) written all over it! Not sure why I'm posting this...sympathy? Advice? A friendly ear?  Maybe a miracle? Yes, I'll have a miracle please! Do I wanna die really... No. But i like to feel it's a good option rather than turning into a nutcase. One morning, when I'm fed up enough. Who would know eh?@@3
280@@ It's been a year since I last logged into TTL. I thought I needed to get out of this place; I thought reading other people's misfortunes added up to mine. I was so wrong. It's been a year, and the nothingness I use to feel has been multiplied. Then, I figured that knowing that people might have it worse than I should make me feel better about myself, but it doesn't. I feel nothing. I don't care for anyone I know; and I am the only stranger I can say I hate. I don't make myself feel better, I can't make others feel better... I've been thinking about suicide too often. I don't know what to do.@@3
281@@ I am sat here Sunday morning and i feel like i am at the end of the road, As i write this i have tears streaming down my face not for myself i am beyond that, but for what i imiange will be the most painful and hurtful thing my parents will ever have to go through. I know for a fact this will end their lives as well. I am not a depressed teenager but a 36 year old male who has had enough of the struggle, I am on the brink of loosing my home, my job and i have no money or career prospects left. MY WHOLE ADULT life has been a constant struggle and have had suicidal thoughts from about the age of 19, I have lived and worked abroad, owned my own business and have had loving and supporting family thought out my life, but for some reason just as i get a foot hold or think i have hope it always and i mean always gets taken away at the last minute I am constantly battling against bad luck the amount of things i have been through in the last 5 years have taken their toll and this week has been the final nail, people who know me even tell me they cant believe how much bad luck i seem to receive, i had someone tell me only 2 weeks ago '' i don't know how you carry on with everything you have to deal with'' anyway the guilt and pain i have  for the way my parents are going to  have to deal with this is just as bad as the despair and pain i have for my self, there is no way out i have lived and experienced enough of life to know this now i just needed a place to put down some of my thoughts, thank you@@3
282@@ haha, sometimes i tried to think of ways i could die painlessly, but suicide will always be painful ever since my first thoughts of suicide, i would always reject them by thinking things like 'thats running away' or 'i still have people who would care' but now after what ive been through getting worse and worse, who cares about those people? who cares i want to run away? i dont like anyone, not even my friends so why should i stay any longer? i dont care, ill just go and die im thinking i'll break anyway after my tests soon , which of course i will fail. i have no motivation to study, even if i did i cant concentrate for 90 minutes straight. i find myself hating every single person in the world, especially my family. who are these people i live with? i think everyone in my family needs help, my aunt said so too. i think shes the only one not in denial. if you get what i mean, my sister was wearing the mask of a confident person starting a few years ago, and now she is confident? i dont know, shes a piece of trash like everyone else. my mum i hate her, my dad doesnt care about the family and he wants my grandpa to die because then we'll spend less money my aunt said so. i trust my aunt but shes a trash aswell she hit me a lot once when i hurt her daughter/my cousin by accident but it felt nice when she hit me because im a trash too and my cousin does she feel she is to blame? is she tryng to help? well shes 5 and shes failing. just a thought maybe jail is better than my house i need help i can see myself im not quite right in the head haha but of course im saying this anonomously since if i called for help then i would get taken away and i bet everyone would be sadder and angrrier please i need advice and this is it cause i need to study otherwise mum will get angry and shout at me more and maybe she'll hurt me this time Im scared@@3
283@@ Hi this is my first post, I've been dealing with mental health issues from a very young ages and have dealt with suicidal ideation from around 10 years old but it wasn't until I was 16 that I actually started to think about doing it properly...I always wanted to but the thought of hurting people was enough to stop me. They say most people don't actually want to die and they just want the pain to stop but I truly, whole heartedly want to die. I've come close to it before...tried different ways but I never went through with it. It was also something that I was sure I needed to do but recently I've had a guilt crisis. Even though I'm an adult, I'm my mothers only child. She is a single mother with no partner and I'm basically her world. At one point I was sure she'd be better off without me. I told myself that having her life revolve around me was unhealthy and that if I committed suicide, once she got over my death, she'd have a more fulfilled and balanced life but recently a wave of dread, panic and guilt came over me and I realised that I might be kidding myself by thinking that and she's just completely breakdown which breaks my heart. No I'm in constant conflict with myself about killing myself. It was so much easier when I was sure I was going to do it. I felt at peace, things were easier but no it's so much harder and the guilt is eating me up. I want to die so badly but I don't want to destroy my mothers life. I don't know what to do, I can't do this any more...there's no way around it but I don't want to have to cause someone else pain by ending my own. I feel like I'm suffocating. I guess I came her to not feel so alone. Thank you :)@@4
284@@ just want to go to sleep and never wake up@@3
285@@ I've been wanting to die since the my first attempt at 16, and I'm 23 now. We all go through crazy obstacles, but even after jumping over them, my mind brings back vivid memories that make me hate myself and the entire human species. To top that off, for the past two years now I've been hallucinating on a daily basis, scary hallucinations. I haven't read a book for more than a year and that use to be my escape. Then last month when I was ready to try to kill myself, I decided instead to go in search of inspiring internet pages. A friend of mine emailed me a craigslist post about a cat, and I just had to. What originally was just going to be a fostering situation, has turned into the best possible thing. My Misha now loves me, she was once so afraid. She was badly abused and confined her entire life of just one year. Now she acts like a normal cat. She is a contract with myself, one I truly hope I keep. There are days when I just want to surrender her to animal control and drink my pain away. But every time she looks up at me and meows, I know she needs me as much as I need her.@@3
286@@ i need to go back into a hospital but my mom wont take me. i told her i've been feeling suicidal, but she kinda makes me feel like im just a burden. She thinks im just making it up for attention.@@4

288@@ Death thoughts is overwhelming.....@@3
289@@ I am a high school senior who has been suffering from depression for years. I have no sense of belonging in this world. I don't feel like I belong or identify with anyone. I am the co - president of club, but the club itself is populated by students who have more pressing concerns and have little commitment to the club itself. I do not often hang out with others at all, other than some people I talk to during lunch. Often those people do things outside of school I have one best friend who I don't see that often outside of school during the school year. I often feel that I am a failure and that anything I set out to do will end in failure. Even though I have lost weight I still feel unsatisfied with my appearance, even though I consider such worries vain and shallow. My depression caused me to slack in school and my GPA dropped as a result. I ended up meeting a girl in band who had the same interests as me and who I found to be very beautiful. I became her friend and became incredibly attracted to her and at one point even thought I was in love with her. I decided to remain her friend as she had a boyfriend at the time, even though she already knew how I felt about her. After she broke up with him I waited a for a bit and decided to ask her to do go out with me. Every time I attempted to ask she made every excuse possible, telling me she was busy or too tired from the long week. On one occasion she told me she couldn't do anything with me because another male friend of hers had invited her to do something. She began becoming crueler toward me and was frustrated with me for ""asking to many questions"" such as how her day was or details about a trip she recently took. She explained to me that she wanted time to be alone from everyone and pull herself together, and that she was rejecting my offers because did not want to be in a relationship. I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt but about 30 days later I found out from another person that she began dating someone else. When I confronted her about it she explained that she had ""fallen in love"" and couldn't control her emotions. She said she was sorry about this and that she would not be talking to me as often and that she could take care of herself. I felt terrible over this and this year when I attempted to contact her she came off as completely disinterested in my existence. She told me she stopped talking to me because she didn't want to hurt me. The last time I saw her in person in waved to her she did not even acknowledge me directly, but simply looked at me with an awkward half smile. I guess all the time she told me she cared about me were lies. The type of obviously fake smile that said I shouldn't even bother trying. I feel foolish being so torn over what to many sounds like a silly high school crush, but she is the only girl who ever engaged or showed any interest in me as a human being. Every time she passes me in the hallway i feel sick to the stomach. Now in my senior year I am fearful of my future, feel extremely lonely, and feel like I have no sense of identity or belonging. On top of that I have developed a strange condition where I am extremely photosensitive and see afterimages of anything that emits or reflects light, or is even remotely light colored. This is accompanied with a pressure in my head and an extreme lethargy. I have no idea if its a neurological disorder or an optical one or if its a recent symptom of the tourretes I've had all my life. It's driving me insane and no one seems to understand what I mean when I describe it. I no longer enjoy the things I used to love to do, whether it be reading or gaming or simply enjoying a good show. I feel completely alone and have trouble even willing myself out of bed in the morning. I have no desire to complete school assignments anymore and am extremely frustrated every time I have to drive myself over there and place myself there where I am simply miserable with the thoughts that are going through my head. I used to participate in intelligent discussions and class activities but I have lost the will to do so. All I think about now is dying. I often strongly consider sending out a mass email to the people I know/knew, writing a note on a piece of paper, and killing myself.  I have harmed myself recently but it is superficial and not remotely fatal. When my parents inquired I simply told them I had injured myself working with particularly rough equipment with the school film crew. I know they suspect me, as the excuse I have given is definitely paper thin when put under any significant scrutiny, given the fact that the self harm is not consistent with any equipment that would be used for a student organization that film school events.... Forgive the length of this post, I just needed to write this down somewhere, even on a forum of anonymous posters.@@4
290@@ I am a compulsive liar. I have lied and been forgiven, and in no way does that substantiate the extent of my faults. I have squandered effort and intelligence to the point where I am at a loss as to what is left in the world. I have destroyed relationships, friends, people, jobs, opportunities, and ultimately existence as a whole. This post is spurred by the recognition of my best friend of fifteen years ending our friendship and pursuing one with my most recent victim, and most recent relationship. We broke up a month ago, assumptively they were together sooner, as evidence suggests. My friend was the one to unravel all of my lies, which isn't the wrong thing to do, but assumptively has used it to create a relationship with my previous partner. I can not speculate on anything that was pre-existing, but I was aware that the end was inevitable. Insight into my insanity is warranted. The above mentioned friend was always supportive, even in my times of doubt, and there were many. Unfortunately it supplied him with an unsurpassed amount of munition to disparage me. The fire was all ready there, they needed not supply more wood. I can not fault them for telling the truth, though, as I recognize it would be ridiculous to have someone else support my mental illness or the harm of another person. I must be completely honest here, as I am at the culmination of my entire life of deception, manipulation, failure, and addiction. This isn't so much a question of whether I deserve to live or some speculation based on whether it gets better, whether I can atone or apologize. Apologies are useless Band-Aids that people use for the small things. I have caused emotional and financial distress. I haven't cheated anyone out of money, but I have said I would pay bills that I haven't been able to. I have done the same to myself. I have cost myself so much through self-deception and trying to cover up or substantiate my own lies. I suppose my whole story isn't the point. I suppose posting at all is a cry for help. I am not here for quotes, or optimism. I am here because I need to speak to someone without purposeless optimism.@@4
291@@ hello...i ...just need to write it.. and take it out of my system...or it will go bad, so... here i go. I am 27 years, almost 28, since i was in kinder...till 26 i've been told to die, i've been humiliated, hit ...heck..once i was beaten up because i didn't know the name of a part of a car. another time i was hit hard because i almost drowned in a pool. The first time i tried to kill myself was at the age of 6..., i stopped trying to kill myselfâ€¦at 25, of course I did a lot of things to hurt me and for trying to kill me, lotsâ€¦anyways. My childhood is one of the things I make myself forget, is everything but pleasant. Everything was better when I was FINALLY able to move away from home and city, to collegeâ€¦ yesâ€¦ I started collage quite big, in two years I was able to meet amazing people who helped me LOTS, I was starting to go healty mentallyâ€¦tillâ€¦ he came to visit. Hoorayâ€¦ I was told â€¦things again, humiliated even worse than those years, I even left collage, thenâ€¦ I justâ€¦ in my statei did something really stupid, I donâ€™t know WHY, but I didnâ€™t die, I just passed out for 14 hours, and then woke up. I was down again, I stopped talking to certain friends, just wanted to freaking die! My mind is really fuc*ed up, let me tell you, I really, really try to be okay, I can be okay a month, but I have awfuls breakdowns, absolutely terrible ones, even to the point where I canâ€™t be a second without thinking how to die. My momâ€¦ never stood up for me, not even once, I donâ€™t blame herâ€¦she just went to another part of the house and that was that. I was NEVER told â€œI love youâ€ â€œI care for youâ€ or.. hugged as a child, so. Yeah. I grew up to be really akward with my feelings or anyoneâ€™s, oh yeah, on top of all thatâ€¦ guess what? I am a lesbian! Howdy! Once that person knewâ€¦it was worse, I was told that i was a whore, that sure thing i had sex with everything that breaths, with every single one of my friends, no matter gender, that I took drugs, wichâ€¦let me tell you, all I liked was beer!  Bear with me, I know itâ€™s a mess this letter, butâ€¦I justâ€¦ ug. Right now Iâ€™m in a breakdown, and I actually donâ€™t wanna do anything stupid, if Iâ€™m â€¦sincere..i already did, nothing really bad, my pet is the ONLY thing that keeps me on line, without her I think Iâ€™ll be under earth, you know? One last part and thatâ€™ll be all, I swear. Iâ€™m okay with me being a lesbian, I love it, butâ€¦itâ€™s a total and completely factor to my breakdowns, like a green light to them, you know, Iâ€™m not ugly, and I do exercise, it helps me mentally and all, the thing isâ€¦girlsâ€¦just hate me and avoid me, no, Iâ€™m not being silly, men keep asking me out one after one, I have count just how many of them had asked meâ€¦last time were almost 20! Yes! And that without the flirts and others, nowâ€¦women..only 2 have confessed to me, if I go and just say hi to one..wellâ€¦ a huge breakdown was when I saw this cute girl walking one day, I decided to say hello, I did itâ€¦and she â€¦looked at me all grossed out and crossed the street, I was devastaded, another time, I tried to say hi to another and she was like super rude. Iâ€™m always being rejected, ALWAYS, 99% of time, I hate being jealous of my two most close friends, also lesbians, they are always with someone or with girlfriends, and they just canâ€™t stop talking about that, it makes wanna cry so badly, I love them, but it hurts me so bad, and I know itâ€™s wrong. One time I was so tired of all that..i went to a bar an almost fucked with guys, I even make out with one, hell, I decided to hurt me up mentally like that, â€œif women just noâ€¦might as well kill me internally and be with menâ€, that of course made even more unstable. I know itâ€™s a really stupid thinking, but after the alerting number of girls rejecting me and treating me like garbage and toyâ€¦I was so lost, Up to today I gave up, people and friends telling me â€œit will comeâ€ â€œthere plenty fish on the seaâ€ yeahâ€¦just makes it worst, every timeâ€¦every single time I fell in loveâ€¦it ends horrible. Oh, donâ€™t take it wrong, I believe that having a girlfriend isnot happiness itself! I just want that person to talk to, that someone who will be there for me, to share warm. Alsoâ€¦ las time I was touched, in any kind of wayâ€¦I think it was over 5 years or more, i kinda grew up to hate contactâ€¦I mean 26 years of abuse is no joke, uh? Anyways, I just needed to write since I got into a night panic or breakdown, I donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t careâ€¦ also, itâ€™s getting bigger everyday the feeling of loneliness, hopeless and more, I donâ€™t really care anymore, I try to be strong, but sometimesâ€¦.the darkness take more and more and clouds everythingâ€¦I just hope Iâ€™ll be able to be okay someday. thank you if you read everything. good night, no, i won't do anything stupid, gotta keep me strong! see ya!@@3
292@@ I'm on medication, have received counselling, psychiatric treatment, etc. I'm now bored of my life and ready to give up... I've had enough of this constant battle and I'm at a pretty big low. Don't know what to do.......................@@5
293@@ How I got to where I am now:- I suffered from depression and anxiety since I've been a teenager.  I don't really have many fond memories of my school years, to be honest I couldn't wait to leave school. I left school and started to work for my dad, I worked there up until I was 25 years old. I had a couple of long term relationships which both run its course after a few years. At 25 I had been working for my dad for nearly 10 years and really wanted to step up and take control of the company but my dad seemed to still think of me as a child and wouldn't allow me to move up the ladder. At this point I hit a major crossroad in my life, 25 years old with my career going no where and had just split up with my girlfriend after 4 years. I made the decision to leave the UK and go travelling around Asia, planned to just wipe out all my savings that I had generated over the years and rent out my house that I had purchased when I was 22 years old. I travelled around thailand, Cambodia, Philippines and quiet a few more asian countries. This was really the peak of my life. The sun was shining everyday, I met many friends along the way and all my problems seemed to fade away, but realistically I knew it wouldn't last forever. Having settled in Thailand for a long period of time I met a women and had a child when I was 28 years old. We married and moved back to the UK when I was 30, even though I didn't want to live in the cold depressing UK having a wife and child would give me something to live for. I'm now 35, my wife has issued a divorce against me and wants to take my house and child and leave me with nothing. I have hit rock bottom, over the last few months I have thought about suicide daily. I have a constant fluttering in my chest which is there from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep, sometimes I can't even fall asleep. I am currently in the process of writing out a Will and have just applied for life insurance to make sure my son is taken care of. The life insurance has a one year suicide clause so I will have to wait it out to make sure there is a payout. I don't fear death, I don't think of it as dying (it's just going back to how I was before my birth). I was nothing for over 4 billions years since the earth has been around so it's not going to matter being nothing for another 4 billions years or eternity. I pull myself through life for the sake of my son and my mum mainly. I know my death would devastate my mum and also leave a huge impact of my son who is only 6 years old and will grow up without a father (even though that would happen if my wife gets her wish and takes him after our divorce). I know the footsteps to my death are in motion, I have accepted it and am mentally prepared. I look back at my past and it's all abit of a blur, I look to the future and see nothing...nothing but a blank space. That's how I know my life has entered the final chapter.@@3
294@@ Long story short- past is a fucked up shit of a mess, bears on the present in every avenue if my life from kids, family to money and prospects. Running out of options,,, sick of thinking about it, tired of crying about it. Drowning in desperation and all i want to do is jump and be rid if this fight. On the outside things look good, the truth is, im a good liar and i cover things up. Sick of lying to everyone,, sick of pretending everything will be fine when the truth is i just dont care anymore. im tired of caring about things that actually will never be what they should be because i destroyed them a long time ago. Dont ask about my past- i wont say Dont look for a friend in me, im not worth it. Dont trust me,,, i cant trust myself.@@2
295@@ I don't know anymore. I've come to hate myself so much I don't know if I can carry on any longer. I'm in a cycle of guilt/depression/self-loathing/worthlessness/suicidal-thoughts/guilt/depression... etc and round and round and round. I feel trapped, alone, worthless, talentless... and in the midst of this in a deep, dark well of resentment, anxiety and regret. Of my whole life, which has been a litany of bad choices built upon a foundation of terrified silence. I'm without employment, devoid of people I can personally call ""normal friends"", without a skill I can call my own, without anyone I can really talk to (my family included), I share no passions or interests with anyone I know including my life partner... I am lost. I feel like the world would be a better place without me.@@3
296@@ I'm depressed -- very depressed.  Little hope for a better life and no hope for a really good one.  No energy left for persuing my dreams, and the thing I want most I can never have. I've thought about suicide before but now I'm beginning to wonder if that might actually be the better option after all -- in other words, my head is starting to agree with my heart. My shrink is on maternity leave.  I tried psych meds but they didn't do anything for me.  I'm afraid if I call a hotline I'll be locked up. My current life is best described by Roxette's song Spending My Time. Life has just become too painful. Pat@@3
297@@ Any advice?@@2
298@@ My rock died less than 2 weeks ago. My rock was my only living family member. I have lived with my rock my whole life. My rock was there for me through Aspergers syndrome, abuse by another parent, multiple suicide attempts in high school, 9 years of college, and the first 5 years of my career. My rock handled everything for me, so I could focus on the career I had aspired to for half my life. Now my rock is gone due to a terminal illness, one in which I had to make the final decision and drive to and from the hospital that day. I did everything right at first, by reaching out to my friends, but I live a day away from the closest one, and they all have their own families/careers to tend to and cant come see me. I am now alone trying to figure out how to make ends meet, deal with winter at my home, and take care of a dog who lets noone else near him, in addition to a full load at a very demanding helping profession career. I am supposed to have a more positive view of death becaude of my religion, as well. I just want to end it all. I had issues before questioning why my twin was allowed to go to heaven without having to live on earth.Now I dont understand why God would take my rock and not me, leaving me here where I dont want to be. Until I can figure out what to do with my pets, though, I am stuck here.@@3
299@@ My mom is a very toxic person. I don't think, she understands, that her ways of dealing with people and with me in particular is very unhealthy in emotional and mental way. I think, this is how she was raised, in an unhealthy home and this is the only way she knows, and she has been like this all her life, plus difficult times and hard life added more volume to her unhealthy patterns. Her mom and dad divorced, then her mom got into relationship with her high school love, who was abusing her physically, mentally and emotionally and then drove her to suicide or killed her (still not clear). My mom was a witness to all of this and she left her home for the reason to not see and be there. Fast forward. My mom met my dad at work. They were not married and his family was against her due to religion differences and in addition to that after many years of seeing each other, she couldn't get pregnant for a very long time. My dad was set up by his family to marry a woman, that they found for him. He kept seeing my mom though and eventually she had me. My dad was back and forth, my mom got pregnant again, this time with twins and she had an abortion (I think my dad still doesn't know about that). That was a big mistake. Her decisions are often based not on some logic or out of the right thing to do, but out of pride and out of the motivation to hurt other people around her by often hurting herself. Her decisions are never reasonable. My dad left for good when I was 11 years old. Since then we were poor and broke. Every year I waited for him to come visit, or at least to get a card in the mail for my birthday, as it used to be before. There were time in my life when I woke up thinking about him, went through the whole day thinking about him, and went to sleep thinking about him, every single day.... My mom was always very strict with me. Her punishments were cruel and unnecessary. She would not let me in apartment where we lived, in the evening if I was late and not on time as she told me to come back after hanging out with friends after school. She would not speak to me for days if she thought I offended her when we had a fight (which was every time according to her). In addition to all of that I was the poorest person at school, because she took me to a school in the rich neighborhood, because she worked not far from there. I often came to her work after school and help her with her work and then after 5 when everyone went home, we cleaned the floors and the restrooms. At home we lived with my aunt and my cousin, who often called me racist words because my father was a foreigner. One time during a fight my aunt attempted to severely harm my mom and me. Every month my mom had to borrow money from co-workers to buy food and pay bills, the next month she would borrow from another person to give back to the one she borrowed the month before. At school I was always harassed by others with questions about my father, since I also looked differently and my father was absent. Despite all of that I was a straight A student, I often won different school and district competitions from art and biology to math and physics. I went to music school for 10 years and absolutely hated it, just to make my mom happy. That was the life that my mom and dad created for me, until I was able to find the way out, by crossing the whole world and moving to the US. Even this didn't come easy. Because of my mom, I went back twice, I felt guilty if I was to leave her and live in a different country and she wouldn't let me just have my life. The third time was life changing for me. There were people who came into my life, that helped me and encouraged me to pursue a life for me, not for my mom. I am forever grateful. When I used to fight with my mom at home when I was still at school, she wouldn't talk for days or even weeks to me, though we lived in the same room. I begged her for forgiveness and cried and she would just walk away without trying to reason with me or have any conversation. If she got upset, she would never explain why and of course would not ever listen to my side. On those occasions when I discovered my suicide tendencies. I felt like there is no one in this world who cares for me for any reason, besides her. And when she wouldn't speak to me, I thought my life was absolutely senseless and pointless and it would have been better if I didn't exist. I tried. I was never brave enough. I don't think she knows I tried, or may be she chose to ignore my scars. One time I tried a different way. I can't discuss it here due to rules. I can just say that my mom watched me doing it and then when I got into consciousness the next day, she said she was afraid for me, but she didn't want to call any help because she was embarrassed. She shamed me and I had to ask for her forgiveness. Yesterday I had a fight with her over the phone. I asked her to send me some paperwork to help me with buying a condo. As much as she says she wishes all of my endeavors be successful, she was unhappy I bothered her. It's been a week and she still didn't do it, and she didn't even care to give me a reason why. She said she would do it next week, I think so she doesn't have to go out of her way and spend her time not the way she wants to. She doesn't care about the deadlines, that paperwork is needed by, even though I thoroughly explained how this works. When I asked her over the phone, why didn't she do it yet, she just stopped talking, without answering the question. I waited couple minutes and said I would call her back another time, and she replied ""whatever"". I was sitting in the car in front of the house, and I was thinking ""WHY"" why do I live? why do I do what I do? Why do I try to achieve something? My life is so fking worthless. I don't matter to anyone in this whole world if my own mom would not support me or come through for me. My dad didn't care if I was alive or had food on my table for 16 years until I found him 2 years ago. I forgave my dad, I understand his reasons, his family ties and religion. I also understand how hard it is to deal with my mom, her pride and her ego. She was against me finding my dad. Even now, when I communicate with him, every time she tries to bring up the fact that he wasn't in my life for so long and how it was his fault, though I clearly said to both of them that I don't want to bring the past and dig into it trying to find whose fault was my whole miserable life. I sat in the car for few more minutes, I cried and I thought to cancel all of my plans and how I would go home and binge on all of the food I have and may be get drunk. By the time I walked to the door, I thought to myself ""oh no, I am not going to hurt myself ANYMORE"". I am not going to let anyone including my mom, ruing my life, even though it may be worthless and insignificant to them, this is the only life I got. I went out with a friend last night and honestly couldn't shake it off for some time. I didn't want to tell my friend what have happened, but when I had a drink, I ended up saying couple words about it, and I didn't think she cared. Oh well. She is not a friend like that, or may be it was just not the right time to share my pain, when others were there to have a good time. My biggest fear is to be a person like my mom. Some of you read now and may be think, it's a shame, that I speak like this about my mom. I think it's a shame. But this is the truth. I love my mom for being my mom and for doing financially everything she could to the best of her ability. She never abused me physically. She slapped me one time very lightly and this was the only time when she asked to forgive her and she still regrets it. But she is nothing that I ever want to be, as a woman, as a human, as a mother, as a friend. I regret that deeply. I feel guilty by typing it now. And I feel guilty for living so far from her, that she brings it up to me from time to time. I speak with her over the phone every day. Because she remains the only person she is ""there"" for me, to some degree I guess. That's why I try to keep communicating with my ex, who is not the best person, but he has the qualities that my mom or anybody in my family doesn't have. He helps me breath through those patterns that go in my family for generations bringing pain to people around and people within. He tried to teach me how to love myself, only with him I started to smile on the pictures and learned to be able to be happy without back thoughts of guilt and that I am not meant to be happy. Yet last night I realized how deeply those beliefs of my life being worthless apart from my mom are installed in me, how strongly she manipulates me. And I don't know how to get free from that. The urge of hurting myself within first few minutes after having a fight with her was so strong, that I thank God I was sitting in a parked car and there wasn't much I could do there, besides sitting and crying. I called her this morning. I procrastinated, and subconsciously looked for other things to do before calling her. I caught my thought of that, gathered my will and strength together and called her. Her tone of voice at first was as if she was still offended and subliminally suggested I apologized. I decided not to, I haven't done anything wrong by asking for her help in a timely manner. I just passed that and tried to talk as if conversation last night never happened and just didn't bring it up. But the pain and that feeling of hating myself that I haven't experienced in a long time, still had me. That's why I am here. At least writing it out and crying it out will bring me some relief.@@4
300@@ I just lost it honestly. I lost the ""fuel"" that has kept me going through this laughable pathetic life for so damn long. I've reached the point in my life where my mind has just run out of patience. I've officially lost it. I can no longer tolerate living like this and being second rate. I don't want this anymore. I never did. I don't want to be that person that is considered inferior that nobody cares about any longer. I never asked for this bullshit. I have no fucking obligation to fulfill whatever stupid fucking psychological interpretation others have of me. Fuck everyone at this point. I've come to the point where I lost all care and compassion for other people. I don't want this anymore. I will repeat that. I never asked to be born. I never asked to be a loser. I never asked to be inferior. I never asked to be isolated. I never asked to be born this race. I never asked for this pathetic laughable life therefore I have no obligation to do those things it's my human right to choose the life I want and choose what I want. Nobody has the right to tell me I'm inferior. I want to change but I have no idea how. I no longer want to be that loser nobody could care less about. I don't care what any idiot here says. The bottom line is I rather choose death than be a worthless inferior person and uncared for any longer. All I want is to be normal. Just to have a normal life just to be fucking normal. I want to be like other people who are not losers. Who are not inferior. Who have people who love them. Who can do things. Who aren't pathetic. Who have real friends and are happy in life. While all these normal people are doing this I am just thinking of suicide every day watching other people live the life I want and will probably never have. How pathetic is that? How sad is that? How sad is it I totally alone in life? With not one. Yes that's right. Not one single fucker who cares about me. I could die in the next 5 minutes and no one would give a shit. What is the secret I missed out on? Why am I so unimportant? Why can't I be normal? Why can't I go from pathetic worthless laughable loser to somebody important? Why does nobody ever like me or care about me?@@3
301@@ Hi, I haven't been here for a long time and I find myself beating myself up already as I start this post. I have been feeling suicidal for a few weeks now. I have told my therapist, my case manager (who wants me in th hospital), and my brand new doctor. I have been honest with them. I did self harm to relieve some ofth pain. All that it got me was 9 stitches I am older and have a  7 year old son and live with my retired mother. She has been through deprssion herself and I wrongly thought that I might get at least some empathy from her. So, I worked up all of the courage thatI had and told her that my case manager wanted me in the hospital, that my depression was gettingpretty bad. Now she won't even talk to me. I have a general idea of a plan and I know that is whn it is getting closeto my needingto be in the hospital. I just fee like I can't go. I need help. Please someone help me... I may be getting diagnosed with MS soon andhave numeous other health issues that are stressing me out, so I do know that this isn't just all in my head. I'm throwing out a rope here hoping that somone will help. Thanks@@4
302@@ I tried, just a moment ago... and i couldnt do it. There's something inside me that makes me too afraid to do anything about this goddamn life of mine. But now i think i'm a coward. And as such i'm doomed to suffer for the rest of my life because i'll be too afraid to make it end. I'm just alive to make every living thing laugh at how pathetic i am.@@3
303@@ I am in constant physical pain, I am alone, and I have nothing to live for or to look forward to.  I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.@@4
304@@ i lost what it means to be happy, i just cant feel good anymore and i know that this life have much beautiful, stuff to see, people to meet, things to do and i just never get the good part of it, why? all of my 18 years of life, all just seem to be gone into waste@@4
305@@ i have taken wrong decisions my entire life and have made myself miserable.  I feel like i have been stuck in time.  Same thoughts are running in my mind in infinite loop through out the day and it just doesnt stop.  I have a very photographic memory and the visuals from my happy days are just running over and over.  I used to be very intelligent very successful in my career but now i am jobless and cannot get a job.  I have given numerous interviews but lack of confidence and memory lapse are causing me to fail every time.  I cannot even form a good single sentence without stopping midway and thinking.  Suicide is something that has been growing on me since last couple months.  Taking my own life seems harder than i thought, i just cant find a easy way because there doesnt seem to be any.  Never in my life i thought i would get to this point but here i am - hopeless, dejected, rejected and nothing to look forward to.@@2
306@@ i kind of stopped thinking about dying for about 3 weeks i think. maybe 4. unfort when i am under pressure i start breaking again. going to hong kong tomorrow. its making me really stressed. then again i get stressed about everything. ive been thinking maybe im better off dead , i cant cope with having ot share a room with relatives i don't know. And 4 of them. and i have to share a sofa bed with my mom so its not even like i have my own space. and ive slept in that sofa bed before when i was in hong kong last. its not comofortable. and when i dont sleep well everything goes a it downhill. I wont have my own space and there will always be someone there in the 'flat' which is literally a one rooom flat and thats it. the climate is completely different, the people, the culture. Even my family arent that nice. last time i went they kept pointing out that my face was red, that i wasnt talking, i was just sitting there like a loner etc. and one of my cousins who i didn't know kept pointing at my face and saying it was all red. i htink she was 18 then? i dont know. obvs she never grew up. I don't know why my family didn't sasy anythign about it. i dont know. I guess im not important enough. or else they hate rocking the boat. even if their daughter is being made fun of and humiliated. last night i couldnt sleep till about 3am cos i was crying for a few hours. the only thing that calmed me down was thinking that i could just get the plane there( so as not to waste the ticket money) and as soon as i step foot in hong kong just turn around and get the next flight back? lol so literally just runing away once  i get there. our return flights are for next april. thats far too long, but at the same time i dont want to comeback on my own because living with my dad is awkward and we hae a strained relationshhip. There's just no where to go. no where i can go. i just thought id gie hong kong a go because it seemed like a lesser evil. I don't know. So when i was really really low last night i just started thinking of the high rise flats that are so popular there, theyre so high up u know? haha . I probably wont do it. i always talk more than i do things. anyone who reads my diary here would know im so upset, im so sad. i dont know what to do. I can hanle crowds as long as i have my own quiet space to go to and relax. this time, i won't even have that. gah. i dont know. i dont nknow what im going t odo. i feel so sad. i can't really talk to my mother about stuff like this because she doesn't really get it. i feel so alone. Can i even come on here when im in hong kong? the computer there is in a shared room. i dont want people seeing me on thsi website. nothingagainst u guys. just. gah. i dont know. im so sad. on a positive note. hey at leaast im not anxious and worrying? :p@@4
307@@ Bad day. Very bad day. Today I can't think of one reason why I should still be here.@@3
308@@ As of this particular moment, there are 26 people viewing the Suicide area of TTL.  I honestly don't know if that is a lot or a little based on past numbers.   But I sincerely hope that those who need support from whatever source they can get it from are getting it... and that no  one is judging whether online support is a valuable as other types of support.  Sometimes due to country circumstances or governmental funding circumstances this is the only type of support some people can get.  Mental illness is a global illness and to disregard it is not only stupid but very short sighted...@@5
309@@ So here it goes. I will try to objectively try to figure out what my issues are and why theyâ€™re happening. At this point in time Iâ€™m on the verge of taking my own life.  Loneliness has cursed me for the better part of my 27 years of life. Though up until a couple years ago Iâ€™ve been unknowingly coping relatively well. The primary problem is that women donâ€™t find me attractive. I know itâ€™s not fair to give a sweeping generalization for an entire gender but thatâ€™s how it is from my point of view. Growing up I used to try to talk to a lot of women but wouldnâ€™t garner much interest from any of them so I figured that was relatively normal. Surprisingly in my teen years I didnâ€™t really pay attention to why other guys were successful nor did it bother me. After high school I start working at starbucks and developed a decent ability to converse with people in general. Plenty of amazing and beautiful women would come by and I would talk to them. Though none of them reciprocated any interest when I asked for their number after I broke the ice. So needless to say even though I was being social I couldnâ€™t understand why women didnâ€™t like me, but I didnâ€™t let it get me down. During all this I was really into lifting and nutrition so I  was pretty lean and muscular. When I was 24, I decided to join the army which was a big mistake for me. I had a lot of unsolved father issues so I didnâ€™t handle authority very well and didnâ€™t make any friends while I was away. I sunk into a deep state of depression from being isolated, I lost a lot of my confidence and self esteem. People didnâ€™t like me. So after they kicked me out for not being able to integrate I came back home. I thought not being in that type of environment would make things better but it was the contrary. I started to feel worse about myself. I attempted to do online dating but I would get very few messages. So Iâ€™m thinking to myself what the fuck is wrong with me? Iâ€™m 26 years old and I still havenâ€™t found a woman interested in me. Iâ€™m still a virgin. So like the desperate lonely fuck I am, I start googling what women look for and what they are attracted to. So then it hit me. Iâ€™m only 5â€™7â€ and my hairline has receded to the point of where I have to shave my head. Girls like men who are tall with nice hair. All this nonsense about how they want someone who is â€œconfidentâ€ is such bullshit. To further test this theory I decided to make a fake plenty of fish account of a guy who is over 6 feet tall, full head of hair, and muscular. But average on the facial looks. I made the profile description one sentence. Long and behold I didnâ€™t need to put forth much effort to get my mailbox bombarded by messages from women wanting to talk this guy. They all wanted his number and craved his attention. It literally took zero effort on my part. My initial messages consisted of â€œHey gorgeousâ€ and I would say more than half of the people I messaged responded back. Though unlike my own pof account, I wouldnâ€™t get any hits back. Nothing. Even though I put effort into my profile. So I realize now why women donâ€™t find me attractive. Even before I became insecure about my loss of hair and lack of height I wasnâ€™t successful at all. And I had all these nonsense traits like self confidence, self esteem, empowerment, passion. It didnâ€™t matter. Women had no interest in being anymore than friends. Anytime I would try to project my sexual energy they would get uncomfortable. But now I know. What am I to do? Granted Iâ€™m working on my muscular build. Iâ€™m more than happy to work on something I can change. But being short and losing my hair is a genetic curse. I canâ€™t fix that. Yet those are the main deciding factors of what women like. So my confidence and self esteem are crushed. Iâ€™ve been going to therapy for the past year and it hasnâ€™t helped. I feel like Iâ€™m not worthy to be a man or a human being. All the while the effects of not sharing physical intimacy is taking itâ€™s toll. We are physical creatures, we need touch. Without it, it makes depression worse. Being a virgin at 27 really makes it difficult to fit in anywhere. All the guys I know talk about their sexual conquests like itâ€™s nothing. I canâ€™t even fathom what that would be like. So Iâ€™ve began to despise women and men alike. Iâ€™m finished living through this forsaken nightmare. Tl;dr. 27 year old male virgin. 5â€™7â€, shaved head from receding hair line, lost confidence from not being able to attract women. Ready to end my life.@@2
310@@ I have been having suicidal thoughts since i was around 7 years old. I am now almost 21. whenever i had to think about growing up i always just told myself i would be dead by the time i have to be an adult, and now that time has come. In school i just always slept and never learned anything so im stupid. at home i just lay around in bed, watching tv, or playing video games. i have never once in my life dedicated myself to doing something useful. i have so many problems including ADD, thyroid problems, severe anxiety, laziness. it has built up to be too much. I dont want to do this out of selfishness. Its not that i think the world would be a better place without me. Nobody said anything to me or bullied me to make me want to do this. I am just sick of life and have no ambition or goal or aanything to keep me going. Im posting it on here in case anyone can change my mind.@@3
311@@ IÂ´ve been struggling with depression since I was in my early teens and now with this episode for several months. I have no energy or hope left. I hate myself in every possible way and I feel totally worthless. My life is just one day after another of sleeping all day long. IÂ´ve been off work for two months now and all I do is sleep because sleeping I canÂ´t feel the pain. I had two previous suicide attempts and IÂ´ve been thinking a lot about suicide recently. I would do it but IÂ´m under 24/7 surveillance because of my previous attempts. That just makes me frustrated. I want to sleep and never wake up...@@3
312@@ I can't be helped, literally no one can get me out the situation I'm in, nothing will get better it's all lies. I am so familiar with death it's my only friend.@@2
313@@ I don't know if I'm suicidal or depressed. I'm ashamed of things I have done, filthy things. I have no one to speak to. Is the thought of an act normal@@4
314@@ Have people decided to leave you or just told you that if you ever mention suicide ever again they would simply walk away from you? Do you feel that you have to pretend everything is ok until the very day you just can't go on no matter how much you try to repress everything as you were or felt punished for opening up and wasn't sure how to communicate with anyone ever again?@@5
315@@ I am thinking of suicide again. I have tried everything for a better quality of life and nothing ever gets better. In fact things in my life are getting worse and working against me. New permanent problems are arising and the problems that I already have are getting worse. I can't do this. When I say I have tried everything I have tried it all. I have tried various types of medications that were unsuccessful or had poor side effects (think a trip to the ER as being one of them), naturopaths, acupuncture, mindfulness, exercise, yoga, sleep hygiene, various therapists and psychiatrists, nutritional supplements, even the Mayo Clinic, a neurologist doing pro bono work who was nationally recognized. I have travelled out of state several times. Countless emails to people across the country for help. Just to give you a run down of my stupid life. I have: 1. Major Depression 2. Anxiety 3. IBS 4. Vulvodynia 5. Chronic Neck issue 6. Pancreas Issues 7. Binge Eating Disorder 8. Sleep Related Eating Disorder which gives me the most stress 9 and....now I have bad arthritis in my knees that I just found out about and the orthos here suck. God I wish I just had a problem that was freaking solvable. I wish I was dealing with a life problem instead. That would be so much easier so in addition to these 9 things that are off the top of my head...I have regular life stress on top of all of that. I have tried one day at a time, different mindsets, perspectives, etc. Nothing works. Because of my disorders my weight is at an all time high. I can't stand it. I have so given up. Every year gets worse, every day is unbearable, every hour I just want to sleep. What is the point of keeping on here given everything above I have just said. I cannot come up with one. I have no supports, no friends, no family that is helpful, nothing. I hate my life and I desperately want out.@@3
316@@ I haven't had a good friend for many years (he died when i was 16 by committing suicide) until about two years ago, when I met a nice 57 years old man. I can talk to him about everything so I did inform him about me wanting to take my own life. Though I have a family that loves me, I live in a different country than they do and they don't have any idea what I am getting through. I have never had a close relationship with them mostly because they have been violent with me since I was a child. I have a wonderful boyfriend that loves but I don't know hiw much he can stand my negativity. We argue pretty often and sometimes he tries to strangule me out of anger. My job is very demanding so that puts a lot of pressure and stress on me. Also I don't earn too much out of it and recently my boyfriend and I made a lian to the bank so we can buy an apartment. The past few months have been terrible, especially when my boyfriend broke up with me one night while he was drunk but we got together the next day. We have been together for almost two and a half years now, but I am in doubt if he still wants to be with me or not. After he broke up with me that night, I went at my best friend and I told him that I want to kill myself and exactly how I want to do it. And if it wasn't for my boyfriend to ask me to talk about what happened and to get back together, I would have done it. I would have ended my life, because I can't find something else that can keep me alive. Abd when I decided to do it, I frlt relieved, that I don't have to disappoint my best friend with my behaviour, that I don't have to fail at my work, that I don't have to respond in front of my family, that I don't have to destroy my boyfriend's life ever again. And that was the mist beautiful feeling in the world. I have never felt so calm and relaxed in my whole life. But it also felt like an illusion, because in the monent I stepped back to reality and embraced the reality, all the depression I have been feeling hit me more powerful than ever. Sometimes when I feel this down I think and actually prepare for killing myself, so I can feel free of any worry I have. So now I don't know if there is anything left for me except death.@@1
317@@ I dont know whats happened to me i was doing fine and then i crashed big time. I have so many complex problems. There arent any answers to my problems. I try and keep as busy as my health allows. Im exhausted today. Just wrung out. i dont want to keep doing this i want to slip off in my sleep. It seems too painful to think about taking my life i want god to come and take it and let me rest in peace. Death is the only way i can ever find peace. There is no peace in life only distraction from how awful it is. i just want to give up. I dont want to keep fighting im too tired now of it all. I want and end tonight.@@1
318@@ I spent a good time of my teens like many did. I wanted to kill myself simple as that. I dont know what was regular of this trait and what wasnt, but I know it is not uncommon of the age. eventually I told myself to get up and keep going and so I did. I did so because I moved from all my friends to a whole new state (this is about the 5th time ive had to do this, and not due to my own behavior) and I wanted to see them again and be able to live like I used to. Now, almost two years later it's beginning to seem hopeless and pointless. Is this really the great world we have? Not to say ""is this it, really?"" I truly love nature and all the world has to offer (except maybe people) I am especially fascinated by trees, space, music, fuck it if its a good read I'll enjoy it. but after working full time and living this ""life"" were supposed to fulfill I'm fed up. I am supposed to raise my future kids in this world? to live in a broken community. broken I am, broken.@@4
319@@ At this point I just have to accept the facts. That I was born unlucky and there is not a single person out there who actually cares about me or needs me. I could kill myself and not one person would even care. That's how pathetic my life is. The only friend I had. The person I loved. Someone I thought I could trust abandoned me and now I have nothing. I'm already a 20 year old man and I have never been loved by anyone. Nobody has ever truly cared about me. Nobody ever shows interest in me or wants me. My life is worthless and I think about suicide every day. At this point I might as well accept that I'm doomed and just off myself and end this joke of an existence. How sad is that? What kind of pathetic life is that? I don't know what to do anymore. Even if I killed myself nobody would truly care. There isn't a person out there my death would actually affect. Because I'm just a worthless loser. Just some unimportant loser nobody cares about. It's just time to accept the facts at this point so I can do something about it. I need desperate advice on what to do. At this point I have nothing. Absolutely nothing. Nobody to talk to. Nobody who loves me. Basic human things I don't even have. I get treated like garbage by most people despite trying my best. I just can't go on anymore. I'm losing it every day. All I ever wanted was to just be a normal person. All I want is to not be worthless. Not be a pathetic loser. Just to have friends and family like normal human beings. Just to be loved and accepted by a girl I would not be fucking rejected like garbage. I have so much hate and anger inside me from all these bad experiences. I feel like I was cheated. Cheated from the life I deserve and should have had. It's only a matter of time before I snap and maybe kill others or myself. I can't anymore. It's just too much. I need help. Desperate help. What is it? Please somebody anybody just tell me. what is it that I don't have? What is it that others have that I don't? What is it about me that makes me so pathetic and undesirable? All I want is to just be normal and not a freak. To just have friends and a girlfriend. But that will never happen at this rate. All I want is to be accepted, loved and cared for like everyone else. All these years of being ignored and rejected has made me hate society and the world. It's not fair. It just isn't fair. I need help. Desperate help. I'm all alone and I have nothing.@@3
320@@ What is it so bad about me? I asked this so many times but nobody ever gives me a real answer. What is it so wrong with me that nobody ever wants anything to do with me or stay with me? Why am I so unimportant and inferior? What is it about me that makes me garbage? What is so wrong with me that everyone treats me so badly? I hope someone can at least give me an honest answer.@@5
321@@ this is my first time on any forum that talks about life stuff so i may make some wrong stuff posting ok where do i start. at first let me introduce myself, i wont speak what my name is but all i want you to know is that i am an 18 years old male who lives in a country known as jordan, it is right near KSA if you dont know it. to begin with let me talk about what i believe started my whole suicide thing i will start with my childhood, and it is full of sorrow. when i was about 10 or so  things started to shift for the bad as i discovered my fathers abusive mentality. He would usually just physically abuse me and my sister for even the stupidest reason such as playing very loud or; actually i remember once he twisted my ear just because i tried to return a shopping cart to where it should be returned, right under a BIG obvious sign that says please return carts here. Anyway he must have thought  i was going to steal it or something because a 10 year old would run away with a shopping cart i mean it is natural for them to do such thing, right?. he didnt even bother to admit his mistake when he saw the return carts here sign. anyway let me talk about my mother, she is a great person and i love her, she always stood up for me when he tried to harm me and in turn she get physical injury herself, what kind of a heart less monster would do this to his wife or children?; a weak one. so how was my life at school, total shit, at first i learned how to hide it all inside of me , my anger , my fear and my sadness all inside and also right now my suicide tendency and this is why i have not ended t yet. anyway at school things were not much i was a withdrawn person i didnt have many friends, always get bullied and i even could not stand for myself, how pathetic, that made me hate myself which is why i now have low self esteem issues along side being anti-social and some depression flavored cherry on the top, mmm perfect cocktail. moving along in my life, you know child abuse ,bullying and pointless arguments and troubles among my family every SINGLE day i reached middle school in the same shitty way as before, more bullying , few friends and still getting child abused how amazing. sometimes i would just cry for no reason but HOW dare you cry in this unforgiving world you must be strong there is no place for people with depression in here, seriously?, and tell me why i hate life now f**ing society. moving on in life, we reach high school now, a tad better now, much less bullying , bit few NEW friends (since my social isolation prevented me from keeping contact with old ones) and everything seems to be better now, NOOO guess who crashed the party RELIGION yes if you are christian and you live in an islamic country , boy you are in for a treat (plz notice i am not saying all muslims are bad but this is my life and this is what happened) so you are bombarded with this crap muslims think like , you are gona go to hell , your religion lets you drink and do drugs and all that such. ironically i am clean from alcohol and drugs and smoking to this day -its amazing considering what i have been through- and THEY are the ones who drink and do bad stuff and they throw the shit at me, anyway it dose not matter now i turned into atheism since i have prayed and asked for help from god many times but to no avail, sooner or later i realized its the same as talking to my family, its like screaming at a wall, no one is there to hear you or do anything and with ISIS going around i wont be suprised if i am beheaded before i take my own life.  (sorry if this offended your religion beliefs but once more it is my life) this puts me here i became like a rotten corpse from the inside, spending all day long on a computer , unable to face society unable to feel love or happiness, please tell me what reason i have to just not end it all , i dont even care about my future , soon i will enter college and i dont have the personality to face it or even do my job in the future, depression and low self esteem are getting and the way and not much can be done as for trying for medication because there is not much a help for people with depression here since hospitals and treatment here is bad , talk to someone? yeah forget it (sorry 4 bad english)@@3
322@@ I am completely alone. I don't have any friends. I never had a girlfriend. Nobody has ever loved me or cared about me. Nobody ever shows any interest or desire to know me. Nobody ever takes me seriously. Nobody ever wants anything to do with me. I can't take it anymore. It's just too much, I had someone I loved more than anything and she abandoned me. Now I have nothing. I am going to die alone and nobody will care. I don't want this. I DON'T WANT THIS ANYMORE@@3
323@@ I am very low.  I am so depressed I cant seem to breathe and I hurt all over.  I keep having thoughts, and my brain wont stop... I lose time and wake up without knowing things. I am in bad shape.  I have no one to talk to, no friends or family near me.  I just want this over@@3
324@@ The Radio only seemed to stir in me great ambivalence, the quiet brought me little peace. It was actually a routine, I'd lie and writhe. I'd indulge in my miseries and contemplate mortality, youth, and all the social activities I was missing out on. I was cold, the breath of AC was consistent enough that I was shivering. The way the cool brushed my vulnerable skin...I'd discovered a pleasure. But I had to walk. At the time, and to this day, wandering outside my room without socks was an adventure not without anxieties but I was practically living alone and it was 2AM, so barefoot I walked out. Opened the front door and transitioned from stone-cold flooring to warmer floors. The heat and humidity were, for once, a mild relief. The warmth seemed to seep through my toes and soles, eventually at my core, a long heat wave surging through my body. It wasn't overcoming but I had to notice. From suburbia, an alien environment, the stars had been outdone by inner-city glow. Somewhere between shrubs and cars were Cats roaming the earth, in their own way. Moon-light hit the roads. I didn't want to leave the comfort of this place, the anxiety of isolation awaited my return. It'd been literal months since I'd had contact with anything worth coming into Contact with. I'd tired of finites and mortality. I'd approached my time in recession with the knowledge that i might die today, not for any one reason in particular. I'd simply lost faith in all, I'd abandoned the world, it'd left me to struggle anyway. I wasn't as numbed as I wanted to be, I still haven't recovered any faith I lost since, but that night, with that warmth seeping through my exposed feet I thought that tomorrow I might live. The elements be damned, the hot breeze passing between my toes had carried with them a chance that I'd live. Somewhere, car engines hummed beyond the tired neighborhood and distant airliners cut through the atmospheres. The city was dying in front of me, but it showed pulse. At least in that instance. I reluctantly returned to my room, fell back and without a cover stared at that so very distinct white ceiling. The AC was now in possession of me, my soles, toes and arms again. The radio hummed, loyal to my disposition as it was. I've always relished in crisper climate, but this was arthritic in nature. I just wanted to see misfits in all their awkward glory, I was alone and desperate. I was hurting. The optimism had receded as quickly as it came and I was shivering again. Bringing my ankles closer to my thighs, I turned. The black holes that surrounded me had found a mass unbearable to withstand, I wanted nothing more than to be simply numb. It was better than this, it was the only alternative and it wasn't there for me. I was truly sober in my depression, there was nothing romantic about it. I hadn't any books to dive in, Pills to fall back with, alcohol to down, pot to dull. I was living under a Black hole sun. A sun that shines on only the unfortunate some. ""We the meek are all in one"". The internet wasn't available either, I had no device at The time but I doubt it'd of made a difference. Little evidence of intelligent of life on such a planet so cavernous, I fucking writhed in physiological pain for 9 months. But I learned to appreciate the experience for what it was, the mirrors I'd made friends with, the silence I'd been forced to tolerate. For whatever it was worth, I relish the memories. Since then I've discovered the nature of barefootedness. It's a gross subject, but it's true. Those months of anxiety and isolation allowed me the privacy to be, self esteem didn't matter and I could expose myself for ever. I refuse to call it a fetish, but I wanted to be seen without my socks of insecurity. I so BADLY wanted to let the world know I wasn't afraid to be me. And my feet weren't gross at all, pale and unscathed from the horrors of calices. To the contrary, I was soft and eager for experience with grass and rain. The world had to know. It had to. The whole thing was a haze of misery if not not uncertainty and withdrawal symptoms. But I needed it, I found a part of myself I'd kept hidden to me. I was 16, I believe...early 16.@@5
325@@ I'm in my forties now.  I never amounted to anything and I never will.  I have no family or friends, but I do have an illness that makes me fatigued all the time.  So I have to face this life everyday feeling tired.  Its not worth it. I don't have the courage to do it, not now anyway.  But I think about it everyday.  I long for it, hope for it, and welcome it.@@4
326@@ Somebody please just lie to me. Tell me it's all going to be okay. Somebody lie and say that you care about me. Just so I can delude myself. I'm so lonely honestly. Tonight I was missing her a lot. My precious friend. I just wish more than anything in the world that I just had her back. All my life I just wanted to be like others. Just to have people that love me and care about me. To have a girl that loves me and I love back. But that feels like almost an impossibility at the moment. It is hard to know that the girl you love will be with another person and not you. To know that life/Random chance has given you a very bad hand and you must be a loser in life. I just wish I could have the same opportunities as normal people. Maybe I have hurt people without realizing it. Maybe I have made mistakes. But who doesn't?I wish I wasn't the person who always loses and gets left behind. I feel  like I have so much potential but I lack opportunities and resources. I  feel like people misunderstand me. Like they take me for the wrong  person that I'm not. I'm honestly not a bad person. It's just that life  has been very unlucky for me. I just wish I could be loved and accepted  somewhere, to be cared for if that makes sense. Sorry for another rant. I  just had to get this out of my system and have nowhere else to vent or  to talk to. Thanks for listening@@5
327@@ As a lot of you probably can tell I have never been actually wanted or desired by any person in my life. I have never been in a romantic relationship. Meanwhile other people have tons of people who like and care about them. Have been in tons of relationships which makes me realize that I must be obviously doing something wrong but what? I wish someone can just give me a clear and honest answer. What is it I do wrong? What is it that makes me such an undesirable? What do other people have that I don't? Or maybe I am taking everything the wrong way in my head??? I just don't know. Someone tell me what it is. Why am I alone? Why does nobody ever actually want or care about me? What is it about me that makes me lesser than others? Why are others so loved but me garbage that nobody likes? I'm crying again because of this. Someone tell me what it is.@@5
328@@ Hey everyone, I just turned 19 a few weeks ago, for the past 5 years I've been feeling depressed. My sad feelings have been on and off. I first started feeling depressed in high school..my best friend since kindergarten had passed away in a car accident. I was in the car with her and her mom and we both survived however my best friend did not. We were 14 at the time. And my dad also has a drinking problem. These two factors were the main causes of my depression since they left me feeling really upset. Because of the sadness in my life I started failing classes in school which also contributed to feeling depressed. I did manage to pull through high school and met a guy who I've fallen in love with. I graduated a year ago and have been feeling better up until recently. Following highschool my life has significantly turned around.. My dad's drinking actually got better and I had a great boyfriend who I'm still with. However, I've been feeling depressed again for the past 4-5 months. Up until a few days ago I've been feeling suicidal and everyday I think about how I'm going to end my life. I know I'm very fortunate for all the things I have...except I feel like too much negativity has happened in my life for me to continue living. My dad's drinking pretty much tore apart my family...I barely have a relationship with him, my mom, or my brother. He hasn't been drinking as much recently as far as I know. But now I just have the most uncomfortable feeling being around him. My boyfriend and I used to be so close. However, we've spent significantly less time together in the past several months because of a new job he has. He works crazy long hours and is tired a lot and he still makes time for me which I'm happy about but I feel like I'm not truly happy in the relationship anymore. Every time I think about him or us I feel so stressed out and depressed. I see him about 4-5 times a week, for about a couple hours at a time. Maybe we'll spend a night together if we aren't working the next day. So we've been getting along well recently, however we used to fight a lot months ago which is making me feel depressed. There's been a couple times when he's hit me during a fight..one time he gave me a bloody nose. After this happened, he held me and hugged me and apologized but I feel like too much negatives has happened for me to be happy with him again. But it's tough because I'm sooo attached to him still because I love him so much despite the bad things that have happened. Some days I feel so happy with my life..I'll feel hopeful. And other days I'll feel so unhappy and hopeless. I think the main cause of my depression right now is my relationship. I love this guy so much but I know I can't leave him because I'm so attached to him. He's had his faults and of course I have to....but he is making me feel so depressed. He has been a much better boyfriend recently so I feel confused about why I am feeling so sad being with him. I think I fear he will leave me of cheat on me if I'm a negative person to be around. So I don't really want to tell him I'm depressed. I feel so unneeded by everyone, I feel like my bf and not even my own family needs me. I don't see my purpose being here. I honestly just want to die....even though it's been 5 years since the accident I still miss my best friend so much and still feel traumatized. As selfish as it sounds I almost want to kill myself to bet attention from my family and my boyfriend. I feel like no one takes me seriously when I cry or get upset. My boyfriend has done a lot of great things for me and I know he loves me. But i feel like he doesn't care as much about me anymore. Since I don't have friends or much of a family anymore my bf is pretty much my only support system....and I feel like I can't even go to him. I honestly want to feel better. But I feel so suicidal right now and I don't even know why, idk if I'm just tired but right now I feel so emotional and like I don't matter to anyone. Tonight I was with my bf and we got in a little argument and he said so many hurtful things that are about to push me over the edge. Our night together turned better and we had fun together and we normally don't fight that much at all...tonight I think we were both tired after working. But within the last few months everything has been hitting me hard.....like the accident,the drinking, the bloody nose, the fighting with my bf. I has tried committing suicide 6 months after the accident....until my mom walked into the room on me and drove me to the hospital. They said it was a failed attempt and I spent the night at ghe hospital. I only remember being questioned by a social worked like why I did that and everything. I haven't attempted sucide since but I'm thinking of attempting again. I have a feeling that if I stick around things will get better....however for some reason I don't really feel up to getting through everything and waiting things out. Sometimes my bf is great for me, and other times he's unhealthy for me. I know if my relationship improved I would feel happier. But for some reason I'm started to not care about certain thungs anymore and I honestly just want to die@@2
329@@ I suffer from bipolar and I'm Currently in the worst state ive ever been in. Just about 2 years ago, I was in the happiest state of my life, I had great friends, I always felt like the life of the room,  I always had jokes, I always got laughs. My only problem that sometimes got me down, Was I didn't have a license or a job, I eventually got my permit to get started working to acomplish this, I would always ask my father to take me driving, He would never do so, He would always have an excuse.  For a whole year I had my permit, Not once did I get to drive, That sucked some life out of me, But I still had hope, I tried to get jobs, could never make it to any interviews, that sucked even more out of me, Then my mother who was the best friend I had, Died of cancer, After every one told me she was going to make it and be fine, I had so much hope built up on her making it, I feel like that was the end for me, I died inside. Ever since her death about a year ago, I have done nothing but lay in bed thinking suicidal thoughts, I litteratly don't have a life, I'm like the mom from whats eating gilber grape. My family are the closest thing to friends I have and they all treat me like shit, I will smoke ciggerettes constantly to ease the pain, As a result from this I have devolped gum disease, My skin has aged prematurely, I'm only 24 and prob look 30-35, So even if I did decide to try to have a life, I'm going to be constantly judged and talked about. I have had admirations to get my life together and become a truck driver as it is a job that runs in my family, But I can't seem to stick to them because I feel like everything Ive ever put my hopes into fails me, I already see what going to happen, I'm going to get my permit again, try to get my licence so I can get my CDL's and I'll never get to practice driving. My dream is to work for a living and have a family to provide for, But I don't see that ever happening, Even the simple life seems like its out of reach for me, Even if I do manage to get a job, Who wants to be with some one who has Gum disease or dentures? Please tell me why I should still go on, Tell me why life is still worth living, Because right now I see no reason.@@4
330@@ I suppose you can say that I've had a history of depression and ""attempts."" I put it in quotes because looking back at it, while I had the sincere desire to stop living I think those attempts were for attention. An SOS to anyone that could save me from the awful pain of wanting to live but wanting to die...if that makes sense. Something has shifted though. For the last few years I haven't been what I identify as depressed. I was neither happy nor sad which I'm sure you know is a relief from the low parts of depression. I decided that I would just serve my time here like everyone else and fill it up with ish I could care less about. I started on a...spiritual/mindfulness sort of course last September. In January I started crying during my lunch breaks for over a month. It wasn't the familiar dark of the darkness that was producing this within me. It was something else. All of a sudden I realized without a shadow of a doubt that everything in this world is a big fat nothing. There is no happy endings. No knight in shining armor. There is no permanence in this world and everything! everything constantly changes...even love. I was not depressed. I know depression as it was my beloved for a very long time. I only know that I looked at the trees and the grass and the people and the nice houses...and none of it mattered. I am miserable. I'm trying so hard not to be but every time I look in the face of the horrible entity they call suicide...I am comforted. I feel peace. I am never happier than when I think about this insufferable pain being over with. The pain that life isn't beautiful...not to me and that it hasn't gotten any better. The pain of being on a 'loveless' planet where the rules constantly change...I failed at conforming. I cannot adapt. I have 2 kids. I should feel guilty? I don't. I feel it would be for the greater good because who I am and who I have been to them is nothing but a puppet. I have no more cares in me. I can't even pretend it anymore. After a crying spell today (as today is suppose to be my 13th wedding anniversary) it hit me--I can't do this anymore. I'm tired. Tired of trying to find ways to hurt myself (which has been emotionally and psychologically these last few years) just so that I can feel something--anything! The pain of not feeling anything but despair and loneliness and inadequacy is just too much. And it's all for naught because it (life) will never get better. I hate it here. I hate all of it and would gladly trade it in for the unknown if it means peace. Rest. For months I have been contemplating but not in the usual way. Not in the innocent poor sad girl who just needs love way. It's been in a philosophical sort of way. I held on because they said it gets better. They said if I held on and did the work and joined society and show vulnerability, it'd get better. I was holding on in hopes that it was true. I was holding on to the world and the value that I attached to it: that it all has to mean something. I came to this board by accident because I was looking for something else but I'm glad I came upon it because it means I'm not alone in that sense. Haven't cornered the market in inexplicable pain...:) Sorry it was so long. Thanks for reading and for sharing on this board.@@3
331@@ i just don't know everything is going badly i feel so alone and lost, it is getting very awful i am seriously trying to improve myself but it is all in vein i look back at my past and it is bad, i look at my future and it is not promising, every time i walk down the street and i see children playing soccer or what ever i just cringe with anger and ask myself WHY?, why could i not have a good childhood like they are having,why did i end up with such awful family, then i see adults having fun and i say why cant i have fun,, why must i always be sad and alone, it is just killing me is there even a point of keep going@@3
332@@ I asked this question multiple times hoping to get an answer that will help me figure out why I'm so pathetic and inferior but I never do. I will get lied to most of the time and get replies like ""your not inferior"" but the problem is I'm not stupid. I just don't understand. Just why? Just fucking why? Why am I always the loser nobody cares about? Why am I always the loser that gets left behind? Why do other people have all these things so easily but not me? It's not fair. It's just not fair. I have never been loved by any person my entire life. I have never been wanted by any person my entire life and I am already a 20 year old man. It's just fucking embarrassing at this point I have never had sex with any girl nor have I ever had any girl actually express Intrerest or sexual desire towards me. I have never even kissed a girl in my life Why am I so fucking worthless, inferior and unimportant? Most people at least have someone who cares about them, hell almost everyone does. Most people have had many relationships and friendships and love their life. How do they do it? What is the secret I don't know about? Why must I be the inferior loser? Why can't I be that person people actually want? Why do I have to be an embarrassing laughingstock? Why am I always the person who loses? Why am I so inferior? So many questions, so little answers. Where did I go wrong but others go right?@@5
333@@ I just wish I could go to sleep forever.@@3
334@@ It causes me so much pain to see the Winners in life living it up. Good looking, Happy, wanted, normal, skilled, in loving relationships with people who actually care about them. It's not fair. It makes me so angry seeing all these people have these things. Those are things I want but how? Why am I not allowed to have these things? Why must I be such a worthless undesirable? Why? It's not fair... All I want is to not be a undesirable freak. To be a normal skilled person that actually has people who cares about him. To actually have a girl I want interested in me. However I was born an inferior race and at disavantages so it isn't entirely my fault. What do I do? I'm willing to do anything to get the things I want. I need advice on what the hell to do before I lose it.@@5
335@@ I'm feeling so incredibly hopeless. I'm a 21 year old gay man who doesn't have a clue how to get it together. I got out of a 4 year relationship on New Years of this year and couldn't cope. I started doing meth 21 days after he left. I've gotten myself into trouble and am facing 90 days in jail and I know I won't be able to make it as a feminine scrawny boy in there. And my parents (who happen to be ministers) told me today that I can either turn myself in on Monday or enter a yearlong gay conversion therapy program where I wouldn't be able to call or write anyone. Not to mention that I've isolated throughout my use so I don't have any friends now. I look at myself and wonder how everything got this out of control. I used to think I was a good person@@5
336@@ I know that may sound stupid and I'm sorry if this offends anyone. That isn't my intention. However this is a very real problem I face and I feel inferior and depressed daily because of it. I am of multi race origin. European being one side of it and Asian the other so I guess I could be half white. Anyways a lot of times I feel like I'm genetically inferior to white people. They have a variety  of beautiful hair and eye colors (e.g. Light blonde, dark blonde,  ginger, red, light brown, dark brown, and of course black, as well as  many beautiful eye colors like light blue, dark blue, beautiful green  eyes, hazel brown and so on) In human history all the worlds major civilizations, geniuses, world  contributors were white Europeans. And this continues to this day. For  example Ancient Greek and Rome (which were white) who basically created  modernity for example Aristotle the father of rational thought. No  black, Asian, or other has ever done anything like this. Today we see that all the worlds most advanced and civilized countries  are white. (E.g. USA, Canada, European nations, Australia, New Zealand  and etc.) all modern technology, discoveries, major sciences were  created by white people.  When I look at my Asian side I feel ashamed looking at how the people behave and realizing I am a part of their origin. How do I stop feeling this way? How do I stop feeling like I am genetically inferior because of my race? Maybe my assumptions are correct?@@5
337@@ I'm sorry for making this thread. I feel like i overburden people here and make too much threads so I'll try to make this the last one for now. There are probably people who have much more important and serious problems than me and need more help so I am sorry. I am also sorry if I don't reply or respond much to people here.  It's not that I don't care or don't read your advice. It's just that I'm too miserable and depressed these days to do anything at all. Just know that I do read your responses and they mean a lot to me. If you don't know already I have not talked to the person I care so much about for about 4 months now. Here is the thread describing the whole situation. Basically I just want some outside insight on what could have possibly went wrong. I mean she used to care so so much about me. She would talk to me out of suicide countless times and wouldn't even go an hour without me. Now she's cruel and has changed. She hasn't spoken to me normally for 4 months now. Here are some pictures to illustrate my point in how much she used to care about me and how she treats me now. I would just really appreciate it if someone could perhaps give me their honest insight on what could have possibly went wrong and why she changed. On why she is treating me like this now. I honestly am very confused. I try to think of why but I just can't really figure it out. Thank you all so much for your support. Your support really means a lot to me right now'@@3
338@@ Those who have some good days are lucky.  Mine are just bad.  I am one of those people who wake up every morning and wish I hadn't.  Why couldn't I have just passed out of existence while I slept rather than face another day of nothinginess, of existence not living? I have been living with depression, and anxiety for 40 years.  I am 60-years old. I have no joy, no interest in doing anything I used to. Suicide ideation just pops into my head at the strangest times.  I went out to my car to take out the CD's so I could listen to my music in my house and the thought just popped into my head.  Where did that come from?   I wasn't thinking about dying or even wanting to die the idea was suddenly in my mind. I like to be in control and depression and anxiety have taken my ability to control my emotions and thoughts away from me. For years I did control my life, I wore a mask and just told everybody I was ""just fine.""  They were awestruck to find out I suffered from major depressive disorder. I agree with those who say that the more intelligent or more educated tend to suffer more from depression yet I don't know if that statement is supported by research or not.  Those of us who think a lot, we do the whole existential thing tend to question the value of life more than those who don't spend time mulling over such weighty issues. My therapist tells me to get out of my head and ""think"" with my heart.  The problem is my heart died years ago.  I have no positive emotions, no feelings of love.  I had hoped that when my grandson was born I would be able to hold a newborn baby and feel the love.  I felt nothing.  How sad is that to not feel love for a child? I also agree with those who say you should not have children if you suffer from depression.  Unfortunately I didn't know about the devastation and utter despair of depression before I had my kids otherwise I never would have passed on my genetic structure to my kids.  Both have suffered bouts of depression already and it kills me to see them suffer knowing I passed on the vulnerability to become depressed. You know the really ironic part of all this?  I have also inherited longevity.  My parents are both 92 years old and their folks lived to be 95, 96, and 98.  So I have the likelihood of living a very long life - and for what?  I don't contribute to society I just use up valuable natural resources that could be better used by other, more productive people. Oh joy.  It is almost 5am and i have been unable to sleep most of the night so the rest of the day I will be worthless, fatigued and unable to function - not that I do anything of value anyway. Thus endeth my whining.@@5
339@@ My life is just so pathetic it's not even funny. I don't have any friend who cares about me. There isn't a single person in this world who actually wants to be around me or cares about me. There isn't a single person in this world who talks to me every day. I hate my life so much. Somebody here please tell me what is it about me? What is so wrong with me? What's so fucking disgusting about me that makes nobody want anything to do with me? What is it that separates me from others? Somebody please tell me. I don't care how mean it is. I just want to know the truth. Why am I such garbage? What's so wrong with me that nobody likes me? It's so unfair. I just feel like screaming and dying. Why is it so bad for me? Why must I be such a loser? Why must other people live the life I want and I always lose? Why why why why why why WHYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!'dukwkejejjwke WHY DO I ALWAYS LOSE???? WHATS SO WRONG WITH ME???!!!!!! WHY DOESNT ANYONE EVER LIKE ME!!!??????? Why can't I just die!!!????! I can't do this anymore. I just can't do this anymore!! I can't live like this anymore. Something needs to change. I don't want to be an unimportant worthless loser for the rest of my life. It's not fair it's not fucking fair. Where did I go so wrong? Why do people treat me so badly??? Why??? Just why why why???@@2
340@@ How to explain, that it is not a thought, it is not something you think of. It is something that goes on with your life, like, you live with it every single day. It doesn't matter if you don't think of it, it is there with you, good or bad days, it is a finall solution. How to live with that, how to go pass it.@@3
341@@ I would rather be dead than alive. The only reason I stay alive is to not hurt my mom. If it wasn't for her I would have died a long time ago. She is the only person in the world. I don't have any true friends, no one. I have hobbies and I do things that keep me busy, but i don't get nothing out of it. I do things for no reason, i don't have any will, any hope, any faith. I'm feel ostracized, like a loser, a worthless piece of shit. i feel like scum. I hate being alive. I don't want to anymore.@@2
342@@ But I don't really want to die. I tried talking to my mom about it tonight but she didn't take me seriously. No one ever does. I guess it's understandable since I don't have the balls to follow through with it (yet). But I'm tired of being invisible. I'm always excluded at social gatherings. I sit alone in a corner and no one talks to me. I guess it's because I'm not very interesting. No one gives a fuck about me.  I wish there was someone in my life who actually cared about me... Someone who could support and comfort me... Make me feel like I matter. I just wish someone loved me.@@3
343@@ You lie constantly to yourself and others. You say you would never do it, but it is all you think about day and night. You work towards it under false pretense. You tell people that you are just not happy and want to leave. Experience life somewhere else. You just need to get everything in order right? Make your apologies, settle your debts, and cut ties. What a coward. Deep down you know you just want to be mostly forgotten. Even now. It is funny how whiskey and weed help to push out the thoughts most days. Some days it takes so much. Don't lie. It reaches that point you know it's too much, and that little voice stops fighting for you ... and you just hear it's ok. You hate yourself for it.@@5
344@@ When I reached high school and university, I wanted to do lots of things. Start with presentations, but I failed almost of them. Every time I stand in front of the audience, I lost my temper, I speak fast and couldn't control my heartbeat, I forgot what I should do and which body languages I should make to control the crowd. Same in love, I made impression with women easily. But when we started dating, I behaved like an idiot. I prepare everything before the date,which I should talk and should not, but later I messed them all. Its hard for me to tell them the story, I couldn't control my speaking speed or my voice volume, my heartbeat lose control again. I've dated 6 girls so far, first time always going well, but end at the same way in 1-2 months, I can't maintain a stable relationship with them. I have a very good job, big salary. But I always feel alone. I afraid to go to party or my friend's house. I usually keep silent in the crowd. I joined charity organization, I contributed the money, but when I went to the locations, I couldn't interact, talk, share with people around me. I wanted to do lots of action but its seem like an invisible wall stop me from doing it. No one remember that I was there. Just like a shadow. I am tired to be alone, to be failed in love, to confuse which I should do, should talk, to fear the invisible wall will reappear and I will run away again. I want that 1 day a woman I love will love me, but I fear to date again, I fear it will end badly once again.@@5
345@@ i am starting to feel unworthy of anything, through my entire life i never felt as a person whom been given respect, i never recall any friend i had looking up to me as a person, mostly because they know how pathetic i am around people and they just try to be nice not to make me feel bad or just make fun of me. I dont feel that one person in my family ever really cared about me, i am such a fuck up in life i never got things correct , they just talk to me because they feel bad, how am i suppose to deal with this, who will ever love me and how am i to deal with life if everyone is just pretending and who knows what they say about me. the thing is a lot of people in my family are.... i just always look up to them how they make things great, how they handle things with confident, they have great personality , one which i will never get no matter how hard i try and i just get very sad thinking about it@@5
346@@ there i will go ahead and say it, i really don't care about my future and the reason is that i never had any past, my past is just full of child abuse and bullying and just general hatred, how did i coop with it, well i spent most of it in front of a computer just shutting everything out from this life and it was a very bad thing to do, yet it worked and i had no worries about it, until i have grown old, to me i spent alot of time playing video games, for me they provided an imaginary world where beauty and dreams exist, any book readers here can relate, but then i hit the wall of reality i came to know how much of an Idiot my father is, yes an idiot, he thinks everything in life is a joke to the point where he makes me want to grab him and smash him into a wall over and over , maybe then he will learn to take shit in people life more seriously. but that is not where my issue ends, i can overlook all of that since i will live on my own some day and do what ever i want, but the thing that holds me back is my personality, i have no social skill what so ever , i don't know how to stand up to people i dont know how to talk to people, FFS just fix this in me and in 5 years i will be in great condition, if i cant fix this then it is over for me there is no spot for things to get better and i will be done with this life@@5
347@@ Everything feels so empty. Everyone is so far away from me and I'm really scared. I want to cry. My family feel like strangers and my friends don't know the real me. Last night I was self-harming. I feel like I'm out of options. My antidepressants don't work and my therapist is kinda weird. I feel so alone. I feel like I don't deserve to be alive. Every time I think of my mum I start to cry because I just wanna be her little innocent baby boy again, not some 18 year old sex-addicted freak who harms himself a lot and makes her upset. I just want to disappear. I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I feel like a monster, like truly evil. I feel like my time is up and every second I live i feel like I'm cheating.@@2
348@@ I'm such a horrible control freak & I just want to stop hurting the ones I love. I have tried to stop being so controlling but when my boyfriend goes out I get this horrible tightening in my stomach and I panic which causes me to be nasty and controlling until he is home. I love him and know this is not healthy but I have been like this with every guy I have been in a relationship with. I have tried getting help but whenever I am on antidepressants I end up getting really upset and attempting. I am a horrible person with messed up background. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. He was my rock the one person I could rely on and now I have pushed him away and the only option I see is to end it all so he can move on and be happy without me...@@2
349@@ I don't want to go into to much detail as it almost kills me to talk about it but my life has become harder and harder. But to sum it up we moved and the bulling started and the thought of having to face each day makes me physically sick. I have falling into a depression and the only escape I get is from self harming and I don't feel like I've got anyone to talk to. My life feel like looking through a fog and the only light I can see is to end it all. I just want to fit in or have someone to talk to.@@5
350@@ how do you  fight your own demons when you are the demon, when your own head and brain is the hell of your life, anyone have the answer?@@5
351@@ Hoping that typing here will help my mind my son who is nearly 20 has A.D.D and anger issues just had a major temper tantrum yet again, i did start something but stopped and just self harmed instead that was so close, no, he wont move out , and yes EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT, NEVER HIS just pointed out that if i did die today, yes it would be his fault, he just put a big hole is his wall. not giving a shit about what i started then did to myself because of his shit attitude i havr chronic back pain so i cant even leave e the house to get away from him@@5
352@@ Dont know how to call it but i am very scared i cant stop thinking of just not waking up@@4
353@@ Hello, Iâ€™m M22. I think I was a good kid in childhood. Studied well, played sports etc. But I was always sad. I never really had friends when I was young. I lived out of city and there were no other people except for my family. I hated the woods and I always thought I missed a lot in my life. The loneliness stayed with me. Also my parent were (and still are) fighting each other, a lot of violence stays in memories. At one point I started to hate my family. The first time I had suicidal thoughts I think I was 16 or 17. I donâ€™t even exactly  remember how old I was or what was I thinking of but I remember the night pretty well. By then I never had more then few zips of light alcohol.  Nevertheless I went out, found some homeless guy, paid him a fortune for him to buy me a bottle of vodka. I only wanted to get enough fucked up to find courage to attempt suicide to end the pain inside me. I ended up just getting sleepy with no energy left to find myself that method. I felt disappointed in the morning after realizing I wasnâ€™t successful in my mission. I enjoy reminding myself of the next period. I was making some good money online while still underage. I started out buying/selling virtual goods but after incorrect elimination from the market I  ended up scamming too many people for a small fortune over and over again. I didnâ€™t feel too bad for myself since the money that I received was originally spent for entertainment. As Im writing this I realize that money didnâ€™t had much to do with anything at the time but it certainly gave me a whole lot of energy. Surprisingly for myself I was very open I was making new friends fast. First time in my life I felt â€œI was someone special â€“ for doing something no other person in the world did at the timeâ€. But eventually it came to the end. I never told anybody about this. My brother dies. Wife and a son left behind. After 12 years of school I went to uni. During second semester I found myself trapped as not being able to understand a few things ever.. So it was a usual day at uni when suddenly in middle of a lecture I decided to stop wasting my time and suffering at the same time and get the hell out of there and never step my foot in this building ever again. After that I spent 2 months in my room killing the days. End of the summer. My house burns down. I decide to go to school again, this time not uni. I do need to drive taxi in the weekends. I find myself in pain once again but it has nothing to do with school since it was easy. Nights after nights thinking where should I end myself. I complete the first year with good results and only half a year to go.. Just to realize that while I enjoy this certain specialism, I will stay unhappy and sad when I continue with it. I just canâ€™t be around people anymore. I want to be sad.  I cannot fake happiness anymore. Summer vacation  is approaching. I won some money from online poker tournament first place. I almoust didnâ€™t play at all until that win. I manage to double the money playing way too high stakes and then lose it all in one day when I was visiting my parents. I still decided to dedicate my time on poker. Left school again. Now a few months later when I believe I can beat the game in mid stakes I still have problems with tilt control and I can not control my actions some days.  Because of that I need to sell my car to pay off my debts. Broke. These are some episodes. After all these years things donâ€™t seem to get better. Iâ€™m numb. I donâ€™t talk to my family anymore, I hate them for certain actions. I donâ€™t want to stay close with my friends anymore. I have been building this barrier between them. Relationships? A lot of short ones. I never wanted to commit for obvious reasons. I hate myself for making countless stupid decisions. Crashing cars, drink driving, riding my bike 300km/h to escape from police etc. Iâ€™m tired of being sad and unhappy and most of all regrets over regrets. Too many  ups and downs in my life. All wanted a stable life but I kept doing everything I could to make it unstable. I donâ€™t even want to go looking for this regular stable life anymore. The other week I went a place. I went there with intention to find myself a spot for the future to kill myself and I did. I never been scared of this method but that day was scary. But my father.. he has already lost a son and I was there to see how did this affect him. Fucking horrible. Iâ€™m trapped in this world.  Everyday I wish I could find a power inside me to take one more step..@@2
354@@ I don't have a future. Maybe I've got an interesting past, but it's not enough. I feel myself moving inexorably towards old age. I can't do this. I seriously can't do this.@@4
355@@ Failure is a terrible weight to bear. I found this forum searching for the fabled forums discussing suicide methods. I am neither ill nor poor (nor rich, but comfortable for now), without gainful employment or friends, being basically antisocial, unsocialized and aggressive. My remaining family member after the death of my grandparents (grandmother / mother very recently) will ultimately need my care when she gets old, even if she currently looks after me, another source of abject humiliation, so I'm in no position to be selfish. I'm terrified of physical suffering. Failure and humiliation are killers, they rip your soul away. Of course, they're self-imposed, but that knowledge doesn't help in the slightest. I also avoid people at all cost. They terrify me. And that just adds to the humiliation. It's a vicious circle.@@5
356@@ I'm not here, seeking some form of redemption. I'm not seeking someone to talk me out of any decisions, because as of now, the decision isn't completely final. I'm still going to ultimately be the final decision maker. I Just want to talk. I want to get it out there. Yes, a plan has been set, and I hate to say it I'm doing my best to spare my family the questions and the distress. No plan is full proof but it's okay. The thing is, I'm trying to make the plan to be a couple years from now. So I'll have a chance to pull myself from this despair. Right now, my emotions are so clashed, I feel numb. I haven't really eaten in three days, because when I tried, I vomited everything, I can keep down liquids, but I find myself drawn to alcohol. I use to have a bad spin on those, and I'm doing my best to avoid it. I do want to go, I don't find this life to be worth it anymore, because I don't find myself worth it. I haven't been the best person in the world, and now I'm finding my wife leaving me for another man, a man my daughter already knows, and apparently for being the observant person I am, I'm finding out last. She says I changed to much from my first deployment, she said my second made it worse, she said she lived in fear of a switch flipping and me hurting her. I never have. Yet the fear was real. I've been having family members die recently, and I haven't been able to attend because we live so far away, the most hard hitting was my little brother dying. He left his body long before I got there, and I was with my family to decide to pull the plug. Now this is all unorganized as I type it, but to me I'm living it. So I can put it in perspective. I've been depressed, and told I suffer from ptsd. And in the end, I believe I'm not worth it. Those that know me, and have a glimpse of whats going on, say I am worth it. I know different. I have to live with me everyday, they don't. And that's something that boggles me about people who freak out about suicide. You didn't live with this person day to day. You didn't know their inner demons, because we all smile, we all move along day to day. True love is a lie. Love is just another vessel for hurt. Life is just a series of events good or bad. I've decided when I go, I'm going to go alone. Part of me, just wants to talk to people who don't know me. Just to get it out there. My name will be forgotten in time, and I will always remain a statistic that will eventually be erased.@@2
357@@ hi, my name is ..... And I'm asking here for help, my native language is not English is Spanish , that's my story , I met the most amazing guy you can ever imagine , he is the most special guy who makes everyone's to laugh and no matter what always made me feel safe in his arms, he is always in a good mood during the morning and he wake up very early every morning , he is a hardworking guy and he has ginger hair and sometimes he talks sooo that make me thinks he talks too much , he has epylepsia and sometimes when he is nervous he forget things , he have had a hard time dealing with this since he was a teenager but he is strong and the most lovely beautiful Irish you can ever imagine and his objective in this life is making other people smile, and I'm cecilia his biggest fan! We have been throw very hard times lately, once he broke up with me and I felt devastated plus I was facing other serious issues in my life , I didn't know how to deal with them I decided to leave and I attempted suicide that made finish at the hospital for 5 days after an helicopter rescued me. But that's another story ,after that I begged him to go back together and we did it ,at this point I'm not sure but I think he felt he had to , then he started to tell me that he was loosing his freedom so one day he just left me without saying goodbye,just one letter on the bed that I have never read and it's broken in 100 pieces now,  that was last Friday today is Tuesday and it has been one the hardest time of my life. Now I'm dealing with so many problems , immigration problems as I became illegal in this country and I talked with the immigration officers there's a chance that the situation will change but maybe it won't happen, they suppose to give me their decision this Thursday and may I will have an open work permit and my life will change maybe I won't get it but it doesn't matter anymore as I decided after a lot of considerations that the only solution that last for me is put a final dot to my last sentence , I decided that I have to die and what I'm asking to this community is first of all is. It to  not to judge me as I have enough judging myself , dear Community pleas just help The cute Irish guy if you can find him ,support him, don't let him down as he is the most important i ever had in my life , last Friday he decided to finish his relationship with me but he didn't know he was deciding many more things, like my life , my future, everything , now I know I will die young, I'm in my early thirties, and I know that I will never be a mom,he told me that probably I wouldn't be a good one and probably he was right,I will never get married and I will never have babies and I love babies so much, little cositas, but my love for him will last forever , I don't want another one or someone better, for me he is the best with all his mistakes and with all his beauty , his beautiful eyes ,his thin body , do you know he grew up in the countryside and he is a plumber , he loves his family and he take care so much of his brother and sisters,his dad and his mom ,he is ginger ,he is Irish and I think to get ride of someone like me is one of the best gifts I can offer to him  his freedom ,he told me as well he is gonna find an Irish woman when he is coming back home , he is I'm Canada now and probably he will make her very happy as he can make happy any girl in the world that he wants jus the chooses that one wouldn't be me so now I'm out of his life , if you see him that I love him forever and my love for him started the very first day that I met him and will continue even after my death as love is eternal , is forever , I love you Mike and I tough to spread some messages on internet so if you ever search on Internet maybe you will find them and you will remember how much I love you mi amor and you won't feel that lonely@@4
358@@ For those of you who don't know the situation I'm in here is the link to the story: Yesterday things just got much much worse. It has been 4 months since she stopped talking to me. 4 Months since the person I loved so much left me. And my life has been going downhill since. I have never been the same. I feel so traumatized by this event. This was someone who I thought would always be there for me. Someone I thought I could trust. Someone I never imagined would do this.  The only person who truly cared about me every day. The only person who was always there for me every day. We didn't go an hour without each other and now it's been 4 months since she stopped talking. I just can't make sense of it. What happened? Where did things go wrong? What did I do to make her change so drastically? Maybe I put too much pressure on her? I just don't know. Well, Yesterday I sent her a message asking her if she ever was going to be my friend again and she said no so cruelly. Here is the message: and I just don't understand? How can someone who cared so much for you turn so cruel? Why is she doing this? Where did things go wrong? What did I do wrong? I love her so much I just wish things were normal again. I don't want to lose her. She means the world to me. Any advice would be appreciated right now. What did I do wrong? Why did she turn like this? and what should I do now? I've gotten so used to living with her and her support that I forgot how to live life on my own. I just need some advice right now. Thank You@@5
359@@ and I'm alone and thinking of suicide again.  I am so lonely and bored and I feel so stupid and weak again.  I feel like the whole world is shit and I will never have any peace in it, I will never be truly happy.@@2
360@@ Hello all of you , I want to take away my life from this world , I'm sure there's hope for other people but I'm just tired ,the only one reason because I'm still writing here is because just to think all the effort that takes to commit suicide , I'm writing and I have to accept it , sooner or later it will happen,I tried already once but it was unsuccessful and I'm not at all proud of that. Tough my life was about to change and everything wil turn good for me but I was wrong, I arrived home and I found that my love was gone , he took his belongings and he just left cause he couldn't find another way to do what he has to do. He left me an envelope with a letter that I have never read as i broke it in 100 pieces I'm not sure if I blame on him what is going to happen and it's going to change some life's forever ,I'm just a product of very bad decisions , im unreliable,untreatable and a lier. Curious thing that when I decidied to stop to do after attempting Suicide for the first time he didn't believe me anymore , poor Michael the only way to get rid out from me was leaving me without saying goodbye ,I know nobody likes me who could do it ?. I feel so alone I tough about dropping the idea of stop to live but it just make me being so afraid and horrified about the future , the idea of going away gives me some relief but planning doesn't . I'm just very tired and I will be homeless,I don't have a job or a work permit and I do have one or two friends but they are too bussy now for attendingy problems , my ex boyfriend moved to another province just to not to see my face ever again and eventually he will move from this country ,I'm trapped and I just left one of the cutest and generous man that I ever met, he thinks I'm lazy and I wouldn't be a good mom or wedding material , an stranger just commented on a very sad Facebook photo status that I'm a sad and ,bitter and I should go back to my country , my ex boyfriend just liked it, he is agree with that,all my life is fucked ï¿½ï¿½ and I miss him a lot but I do believe that he deserves someone better than me . at least I did a lot of nice things in my life and I enjoyed his love while it last, I'm just looking for some piece@@2
361@@ Really? The life I have made for myself has brought me nothing but unhappiness. I married someone who leads a double life and because of all that he has hidden from me that I now know I cannot leave him because it would jeopardize my freedom and the lives of my children.  I cannot go into detail because there are certain components of my circumstance that if discovered by the right (wrong) person would collapse the delicate web of this life my husband has made me live against my will and then there really would be no reason at  all to continue. I used to think the reason for life was love.  I married a man who I believed loved me. We have seven children together. My god, I hate to even be on this forum admitting that O have seven children and I am here as hopeless in life as possible. My husband is not a husband. He is not a father. He is not a provider, not even employed. I do it all as he is never there. Our lives gang by a thread. What he does is so against my moral fiber but he has made it so I cannot leave. I truly cannot.  I raise the kids by myself, I hold my stay at home job, I go to church. I am a slave and a prisoner. I have too many children, too big a house, too many messes to be the mother I would like to be. When you don't have a real partner, it is very hard. Women complain about their husbands, but my case is truly something phenomenal. I am a college graduate, was upper class American family. I gave it all away, every part of myself when I married this man who's secrets I did not know. Now I do everything for him and my family because if I do not it simply will not get done. the crazy thing is that I am an amazing person. And I know this- I am so resourceful. I am a very hard worker. I am proud of the work I do daily and of all my accomplishments. But I do not have a single shred of happiness in my life. My resentment of my spouse leads me to feel angry with my children for being children because he is not present and I cannot keep up. I cannot stop the headache. I cannot do this alone. My spouse doesn't even know I exist. Not only do I know that I am an exceptional individual, I also have great beauty. He is so self absorbed that I am simply nothing to him, even though I am too good for him in all ways. Four days ago I had a break down. His family all has a lot of problems and recently there was safety hazards in my life due to his family's troubles. Can't give detail again, not paranoid but there is someone seeking me out online. I hadn't seen him for a month except for in passing at our home so I texted him that I am having a break down. Because the kids need someone who is not such a mess right now. I mean, I can barely even get out of bed and this is just a terrible situation for them. I'm usually much stronger but really, everything bad that could possibly happen in the course of an entire lifetime (apart from losing a child) has hit me right at the same time. I texted him to say I need help. I cannot do this. I am very unwell. He showed up several hours later. No help, no nothing. Just tells me I need to get on medication. And then he went to his room. That's right. His room. Sure, maybe meds would help me not dream of death as much. But medication will not change him or the life I have no way out of. Literally. No way out. I have no joy. Not for years. Sometimes I will have fleeting moments of happiness found in the arms of my babies, but their arms do not keep me from the torture I feel daily due to my extreme circumstance. So what's the point? When my life ends, I will have done nothing remarkable in this world. I will have done the best job I could do at raising my beautiful children that I love dearly. My children will pave their own paths. If happiness and joy really exist in this world perhaps they will have good fortune and find it. And then they will have children and eventually die and that was it. A life of misery and suffering every second of every day to not even hold any long term value. No one will ever know how hard I have fought and struggled, or how much I have accomplished through this nightmare life I live. No one will remember me, or know me. Poof- gone in an instance like I never was...@@3
362@@ ever since I became aware that I have a nervous disorder my self esteem started to sink. as each day came and went and I became conscious of how much I was worrying all the time, I started to feel unhappy with myself and that feeling has lasted throughout childhood right up to the present time. for example I had a conversation with a person who lives on the opposite side of the street for the first time and I was conscious that I was trembling. I could feel my head nodding as per normal and I kept thinking to myself I wonder if she notices that my head keeps nodding? I felt like telling her that I suffer with bad nerves but I decided to keep that private. I used to use cannabis and alcohol to help calm my nerves but when I think back to those days I know that I was kidding myself. I'm sure my head still nodded and my hands trembled all the time as normal. I also realize that throughout all those years I was crying out for help without actually saying a word. I was communicating by actions such as wearing two pairs of trousers because I was worried that my legs were too thin and I hated the flared trousers my parents would buy and force me to wear. I was also crying for help by bunking school instead of going to learn as much as possible. one way or another I was crying out for help and few people noticed. my parents knew that Something was wrong with me but they didn't know how to help me? its not surprising that years on I still feel unwell physically and mentally. in fact I feel even worse now. I feel evermore insecure and unhappy and I find it difficult to see a way out? therefore its natural that I think more and more about committing suicide. I don't want to do it but I feel that as long as I continue disliking my life and life in general I'll continue viewing death as something far better even though I know I'm kidding myself. I know all my hang ups and inner and outer problems will end but I won't be able to enjoy the feeling of being free because I'll be dead. after 48 years on my road I'm growing evermore tired of my life. I dislike it in so many ways. I find it difficult to see any value in my existence. like kirk cobaine sang in his song I also feel stupid and contagious and tired and fed up. if it wasn't for the fact that my mum is still alive I think I would go ahead and bring my life to a permanent end. because I can't see things improving. I feel so tired of life. going through the same routine day after day etc sometimes I wish I could be in an accident. I sometimes feel like being careless and hope it will bring my life to an end. but so far I decide not to go through with it only to end up feeling like I feel at present. does anyone else feel similar? I'm at the lowest point of my life. I think about suicide daily and don't really care if I wake up. I've lost everything and it was all my fault. I don't know why I keep going. The only real reason I guess is my kids. Everyday seems to get harder and harder though and it's incredibly hard to look at the world.  I see no beauty, have no happiness, my dreams are shattered, my finances in ruin, nowhere to turn. I wish I had some answers.@@1
363@@ Hello, At the end of this past March I attempted suicide. I ended up in a mental health center for about a month and was put on anti-depressants. That was almost 5 months ago and while I am definitely doing better, whenever I have a really rough day the thoughts of suicide are there almost instantly and I have a lot of trouble shaking them off (I only have these days maybe every other week). So my question is: How long did it take you to stop having intrusive suicidal thoughts? Thank you all for any advice you can provide and have a great day.@@1
364@@ I'm just so tired of living. I'm done pretending that I'm okay. I don't want to hurt my family but this feels like the only way to finally be happy. I don't know what else to do.@@1
365@@ Hey,i'm turning to forums like this since i have nobody to speak to. I've had pretty bad depression and anxiety for some years now and i'm sick of it.I'm sick of feeling numb all the time.Some days i feel like i have no emotion at all.I honestly cannot live like this,i want to have fun and fall in love and do everything a normal teenager does.I should be happy.I passed my exams and got into a good college recently but i still feel completely numb. I don't even know what to write here.I am so so lonely and everybody tells me 'it gets better' but my life has gotten better.I still feel like sh!t.I feel like no matter what happens i will still feel like this. I think about suicide almost every hour of every day,Idk i have attempted multiple times.I have no reason not to commit.Maybe i will do it one day.@@1
366@@ All I want is to be normal. That's all. Nothing too much. Just to be normal. To actually be wanted by girls I like, to actually have real friends that actually want to be around me. To no longer be inferior garbage. To not be a fucking pathetic laughingstock and actually become a person who can do things and be admired and wanted. Not some fucking joke. That's all I ever ask. To no longer be a powerless coward who can't even control his life. These things are all I want. Why is that so hard? I don't owe anybody anything and I never asked for this existence therefore I have the right to choose how I want to live my life and what I want and this is what I want. Why can't I just have those things? I just need advice on how to accomplish these things.@@5
367@@ Another fucking day of being alone while watching others in friendships and relationships being wanted and desired by others while I am all alone. All that comes to mind is ""why me? What did I do to deserve being alone? I don't want to be told I will be like this forever. I can't live like this anymore, something has to change but what? What do I do? How do o change this? How do I turn this miserable life to a good one? I honestly have no idea. Why can't there be someone who actually wants or needs me? Why do I have to be that person that is unimportant and not known anywhere or wanted? How much longer until I go insane and hurt others?@@5
368@@ No note, no traces, no goodbyes Just an anonymous message that's gonna soon be removed... F*** this life@@3
369@@ today brought it back to me so clearly how I am destined to be a loser, whether it's genetics or just something else, the fact is the fact.  I am not as liked as other people and I am never going to be as successful as other people.  There isn't one thing I can do well.  I am so tired of living this tired existence, never achieving anything.@@5
370@@ I want to go peacefully.. I'm so tired of everything.. I'm tired of all the sadness and pain.. I've survived my first heatbreak, but I dont think I can go through that again with all the sadness and pain x10000000000 more this second heartbreak.. I really cant do this anymore.. I think I've done everything for my family already so I think I can go now.. I just want to be happy with God in heaven.. I want all of this suffering to end@@2
371@@ As things grow worse, or remain stagnant (either way is bad) I find myself looking to the thought of suicide as a form of comfort. It actually comforts me just knowing that it IS possible for me to take my own life if things were to become entirely unbearable. Regardless of how poorly I might be doing at any time (sometimes worse than others) I find this thought creeping up on me more and more nowadays than it ever did, and it's very comforting. Even if I may not be doing AS bad as I have been on other days, the effect is still the same, this eerily soothing feeling washes over me when I remind myself I can always end things, at any moment. It's something about the fact that I know that at any point, I can always take my own life and all of this misery will be completely over. All I have to do is work up the courage to do it, or have the perfect excuse that would give me that extra push to be able to do it. There's a lot of different situations that are going to be presenting themselves to me for the rest of this year, they're not going to be easy. I know I'm going to be using this ""Coping mechanism"" to get me through things. Remember"" I tell myself, ""It could be now, later, tomorrow, 2 days, 3 days, a month, a year..it could be anytime. You could end it. It will be over. Now breathe that sigh of relief.@@3
372@@ Another Saturday night alone at home, overthinking, feeling like crap and wondering why I'm still here ?! Since I was born, I've always been suffering ... Honestly, I think I've never been happy and I can't take it anymore. Worst part is that I feel like I've nobody to turn to, that nobody care. Today there was a family reunion, everybody seemed happy ... Why wouldn't they ? All of them have succeeded, in both professional and personnal life, I'm the messed one, the outsider in the family, in my late twenties and still trying to figure out who I am, what I want in life (do I really want something ?) Sick of loneliness, sick of making the wrong choices, sick of disappointing people, sick of being judged, sick of feeling sad, lost, hopeless, sick of this life ...@@4
373@@ well i just received news from a college that i was accepted in their engineering program, and since my cynical personality has the upper hand i do not know what to really make of it, my personality, the way how i act, i don't think  i can deal with college while being like this, ughh what should i do :(... i feel so lost@@5

375@@ Why do people always give you hope, only to snatch it away again and leave you feeling worse.@@5
376@@ So I am new here, however I am so lost in my life so I guess it only makes sense that when I googled, ""how to kill yourself"" this forum came up. Instead of asking how, I figured out that this is a site that you can talk to other people so I am going to try doing this first. Hopefully it helps, maybe I will make a few friends and I will be able to find myself again. Lets see, I am 29 years old, I feel like I am 100% ready to give up. When I was 18, I was in love with this incredible guy named Brian. He got me pregnant and we had a son, and then within 3 months I was pregnant again and I had a daughter. In 2008 we got married. Our lives were amazing. I had 2 beautiful children, and amazing husband. I had owned my own photography business and I was earning nearly $3,000 in a weekend (Each weekend) he was earning almost $40 and hour on a dairy farm. But we lived comfortable. We were happy. not all the time and our marriage was far from perfect. Before we got married he had slept with another woman and got her pregnant. Though this never was proven due to the fact that in 2009, my husband had a heart attack and passed away. I was 23 years old. The only thing I had ever known was gone and I had 2 children that I needed to provide for on my own and explain why their dad would no longer be able to be around. After Brian passed away my mother, took advantage of the fact that I got nearly $3,000 per child for survivor benefits. She decided to conduct this story (lie) that the father I had known for 23 years wasn't my biological father, that I should go to Georgia (we live in Ohio) and meet him. So after a few months of speaking with him. In November 2009, I decided to ask my husbands parents to watch my children as I went down to meet him. I thought it would be a positive thing with all the negative that had been happening. I went down as I was about to head into the Starbucks to meet him, I got a phone call saying he wouldnt be able to make it that day. Okay, no big deal. My next phone call however, was my very frantic mother in law saying that my mother had emergency custody papers of the children and I needed to get home right away. I drove to Georgia, so I immediately got in my car, went to the hotel threw my belongings in my car, checked out and sped all the way back to Ohio. When I got here I went straight to my children, only for my mother and the police to show up and take my children away from me. I had to go to court. In the court room my mother tried to say that I abandoned them, that I locked them in my house and left and no one knew why. When I showed the courts everything about this supposed father, and I had my husbands parents as witnesses that I had the correct form of baby sitters and that my children were safe. My mother said that I abused them and the courts said then that there needed to be an evaluation. She also tried to get me evicted by telling my landlord that I locked them in the house. My landlord unlocked the door and my mother when in and uprooted my house to find my journal, where it talked about how depressed I was because of just previously burying my husband. Unable to function with life and all of its curve balls, I gave up trying to fight my mother. I started to drink heavily to not think about the pain, when that wore off I started on hard core drugs like coke, molly, ecstasy etc. It wasn't until I met this guy Ben that I stopped doing all of that. I started to see my kids again, I got clean, for a while I was happy. We fought off and on. He was a computer nerd, who always played games like World of Warcraft and League of Legends. His priority was games and mine was life. We were engaged but for 3 years I put up with the bullshit. During those 3 years, I got pregnant (2011) with twins, who were born 13 weeks early due to twin to twin transfusion. They were in the hospital for 78 days and required a lot of therapy to get back on track. In July 2012, one of my twins Holly, had gotten hydrocephalus (water on her brain) she got a shunt put in to drain the fluid but this delayed her even more. Then they determined in 2013 that she had global brain damage. In September of 2013 I left Ben, I couldn't take it any more he cared more about his games and online friends then he did me or our daughters. In December 2012 while in her fathers care, Holly's leg got broke (supposedly she got it stuck in her crib) In 2014, I got a call from the hospital saying that I needed to come up right away. Holly had passed away in her fathers care. Because i didn't have custody of my first 2 children, getting custody of my daughters was next to impossible. I had this plan in May 2014, I became a sugar baby, I used guys for money so that I could save up enough to buy a shit ton of coke. In June of 2014 I met this guy named Bryan, he seemed so perfect. I got rid of the sugar daddy, I stopped the drugs again. I fully committed myself to him so much that I married him. (only knowing him 1.5 months) I knew that he was a computer nerd, but during that month and a half he was barely on the computer. He seemingly loved me. Now we are still married however, before I married him I made him promise that he would never play league of legends or world of Warcraft. a year a few months in and his priorities have become playing league of legends, when I ask him to spend time with me, he says he will when he is asleep. I can not ever express how I feel, because instantly I am just trying to manipulate him and he shuts me down. He talks to his friends online so I am unable to talk to him about anything and scheduling me in is impossible. At night when we lay down I try to talk, but then he says no I am tired, its time for bed. Last night, I tried to tell him that I am so depressed that i want to end my life and he blew it off and said its bed time. Talk later. Later never came. He tells me that if I want to do this or that, that I will give him sex or let him do what he wants. When he is talking to his online friends, if I start talking he instantly mutes the mic and gives me a huge attitude and says I am fucking busy. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel lost, I feel like I am re-living the 3 years of my life that I had with Ben, only this time I am married. I miss my children who now call my mother, mom. They know who I am and they know what is going on that she tries to keep them from me, so much to the point where my kids sneak and talk to me on the phone later at night or even on the Xbox. She told my son that these birds that fly above his game are his dad and when they aren't there that means that his dad is mad and disappointed in him. I am currently in school, I am starting my photography company back up, and I also do custom designed high heels. I have so much going on to keep myself positive and busy, but in the very second that I am not studying, or being creative. All of the pain and hurt kicks in and I am ready to give up. The most screwed up part is this: In my mind Divorce is not an option however, ending my life is. I need advice and help. Not for my marital issues but for my life in a whole.@@5
377@@ Hello. I had an accident about 5 years ago its was very bad, coma; aphrasy, E etc we had tickets but she went i sorted but thats i tried suicide 3 times so i went back to my parents and now i have the memories of J.G abusing me at worked me for about 1 year and i taked his parents in in the middle on the night, i went throw the bathroom window taped the door, hide and i didn't manage to do anything but talked to him (the dad) with a knigh.

379@@ There are people in this world who have everything from the moment they are born to the moment they die. It makes me so sad, angry, miserable and fills me with so much viscous rage knowing how unfair my life is. It just isn't fair. Why do some people get to have great lives but not me? I deserve all that too. I never asked for any of this. I don't deserve to live like this. I don't owe anyone a single thing so why the hell should I have to answer to anyone? Why the hell do I have to put up with this shit? Why the hell do I have to go through this while others have amazing lives? It just proves what a sick fake joke this world really is. There are people who have beautiful lives and tons of people who care about and love them whereas I don't even have one. There are people who find beautiful romantic relationships with people who love them and these actually last meanwhile I have not been in one real relationship my entire life. Who would even want to be with a loser like me when there are so many better people out there to choose from? nobody. Why does it have to be so unfair? Why do I always lose? Why can't I just have those things? We all know that will never happen. I can't take it anymore. I can't. I am going crazy honestly. Every day I get closer and closer to losing it and hurting myself. It's so unfair. Do you know what it feels like to be that loser that nobody cares about? Do you know what it feels like to see everyone else live the life you want knowing that you will die alone and forgotten? Do you know what it feels like to be powerless? Do you know what it feels like to see people you care about taken by others? Do you know what it feels like to see people living the life you want knowing your life will be less than garbage and that you will never have those things? Do you know what it feels like to see other people in love and together while you are just some worthless inferior loser that nobody could care less about? I'm going insane. I can't take it anymore. Why is it this way? Why am I so worthless? Why am I such an undesirable?@@4
380@@ I've been concerned with how I've been feeling for years but I've never discussed my feelings with anyone because I'm scared. Just writing this post is making me anxious and uncomfortable but I think it's a good first step to help deal with what's going on. This past week I've been feeling really suicidal. I'm actually surprised that I haven't done anything yet. My thoughts are beginning to scare me and I'm scared that I'm just going to give up trying. I've felt this way before but I've managed to work through it but this time feels different somehow. I don't really know how to seek help for what's going on and I feel like things are not going to improve any time soon. There's only so many times one can say things will improve and actually believe that it's going to happen. I've been tempted to go to the emergency room but I'm scared. Just thinking about it I can feel my anxiety levels rise and my heart pounding in my chest. I also have so many things coming up and so many things to do that I can't imagine what would happen if I would have to stay in the hospital for any length of time. I also don't know if I can actually muster the courage to tell someone that I'm not fine and I need help. I don't want to kill myself but I do and it's beginning to feel like more and more of a good idea every day. I'm feeling awful and so confused that I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm a 21 year old female and I live in Canada. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this in real life so any advice would be extremely appreciated. Thank you!@@1
381@@ Let's be honest here. I've never had a real job in my life and most likely never will. I've let the whole world pass me by. While everyone is doing great things, I can barely get out of bed every day. I am reminded daily that I am a failure who can do nothing right. All I do is waste time and drain resources. I had a chance to escape from this hell hole, but my family squashed it without a second thought under the pretense of ""doing what's good for me."" It's really just so they can kick this worthless person around some more. I will never be good enough for anyone especially myself. I have come to accept that. The only good I can do is to die. I don't want to keep going anymore.@@1
382@@ I've had a lot of deaths lately in my life and my pets dying was the absolute worst because unlike with people, I feel entirely responsible for my pets. I failed my pets, and I failed my objective in life which is to serve my pets, among other things. I know this sounds silly, I hope I do stir up some laughs, but the pain of this reality...I can't change it. I want to be with them. I really want to see my pets again and be sure they're okay. I'm not even sure if there is an afterlife, I'd like to think so. The probability alone makes me want to end my life and be sure that they're not suffering still. I have a soulmate, a family and friends that care for me, but that isn't enough to make me want to stay. I want them back! They were my children. I'm childless and I don't plan on having my own children, so this is really hard on me. Please, if you respond, don't undermine this and tell me that 'they're just animals' and 'get over it'...That attempt at rationale does nothing for me.@@3
383@@ since i have posted here a while ago i decided that i want to change my life a bit, to try for a second chance and things have not worked out greatly so i decided that since not many people are out there are to help me why dont i ask for advice on this forum the things i need advice about are the following 1 letting go of that past and a grudge i suffered from physical child abuse in my childhood which left me with a grudge against my father how am i to leave all that circulating pain of such memories behind? (hardest part) 2 self esteem i have very horrible self esteem issues from the abuse and bullying i suffered from, how do i raise that esteem 3 social anxiety it is keeping me locked in my own home and it is one of my most major issues i can go out like to the corner store to get stuff but like sleep overs and friends hangout.. not so much :( also i am not good at talking to new people i am scared of saying something awful that will make me look stupid and before you ask no it is not a phobia of open spaces 4 self expression i can never get to a straight point in any conversation i just cant say anything that rolls in my head somebody help me with that 5 depression the true monsters that lives in people heads... make it go away also please do not suggest medicine or anti- depression drugs , medicine and treatment in here is straight BS also i cant accept the idea that i must live my life on pills@@4
384@@ It doesnt get better for me, with my wife basicly telling me how terrible of a person i am everyday even though i feel i try so hard. i have a daughter and shes really the only reason im still around. I feel like once shes either okay on her own or once my wife pushes me to the brink i wont be around.@@4
385@@ All my life I have been that worthless person that nobody could care less about. Just that second class loser that people don't even consider or desire. Honestly I'm not a bad person and I never did anything wrong. I don't deserve this at all. I don't want this. I know people here will laugh at me and mock me to make me feel worse but I don't care. I have nobody to turn to except the internet because I'm just some worthless person nobody wants. The fact is my existence does not matter to and benefit anyone. I think I have a lot of potential but I am very unlucky. I can no longer tolerate or have any energy left inside me to be that worthless loser that nobody cares about. I never asked for this. Never. I never did anything wrong. I never hurt anyone. For the first time in my life Suicide is actually becoming a REAL and SERIOUS option for me. What's the point if you will just be some inferior laughingstock and alone for the rest of your life?  I have no obligation to anyone for this life therefore I don't have to live as the worthless inferior loser. I don't choose that life. I never did. Never will. But what the fuck do I do??? How do I undo this nightmare? I don't want to live like this. I am the kind of person that nobody cares about. That nobody would ever actually choose to want or desire.  A successful person with self respect and a good life that is. I am the kind of person nobody ever thinks of or cares about. All my life I have never been loved or wanted by one person. Not one person. Never in my life has anyone actually ""wanted"" or ""chose"" to be with me or had any ""desire"" to be with me if that makes sense. Like I said I'm just that person nobody could care less whether dies or not. You can say that I am only 20 and still young but I feel like it's already to late. I feel like my personality has already been far too damaged enough to be a normal person. I feel like I have missed the train if that makes sense. Just a dumb analogy. People here can lie and say they care but it's not true. I have never had a girl I like or wanted actually ever have any interest in me or liked me. Never had sex even. I never even kissed a girl before. That's how sad and pathetic my life is. Go ahead and laugh and mock me all you want. I won't lie anymore. I have never been in love with a girl that loved me back. I have never had a true friend in my life. I have always been that powerless loser that just about anyone can take advantage of and discard at will. I don't care what anyone here says. The bottom line is: I want to be like this. I want to be a pathetic inferior loser anymore. I don't know how to change this. Is it hopeless after all? Am I doomed for a life alone? Am I doomed to be an inferior laughingstock for the rest of my life? Will I ever be normal? Hell look at normal peoples lives. Normal people have tons of relationships, fall in love, have real friends, have people who actually care about and want them, are not powerless like me, Are good looking, are free and happy (able to loudly express themselves and attract others) are traveling the world and happy whereas I am just some loser nobody knows or cares about. I'm so miserable. What should I do? How do I find people I actually want? How will a girl I like ever want a loser like me when there are so many better options? Help. Please Help@@4
386@@ Release me from my troubles. Release me from my pain. Release me from the vanity of egoism that I feel again. Release me from fear. Release me from anger. Release me from what's passed, and the future always near. Release me from myself. I was not meant for this world. If I'm not here I can hurt no one, and no one can hurt me.@@1
387@@ My whole  adolescence was filled with constant fights between my parents and older sister the fights were physical sometimes and my parents weren't the best at reacting well.they held her mostly.but my dad hit her in the back of the head a couple times once and i swear he came close to seriously hurting her another time not for my mom.the fights left me suicidal and acting out myself but i also exhibited violent behavior towards my father.we had physical fights.he left welts on me and i left marks on him police were never called not on me or my sister for our behavior or my parents. I honestly didn't want that i felt like cps would separate me and my siblings and i didnt want that.i know all my behavior now happened because of those years living in that house as a teenager we weren't there for very long but it was not good. And now i still live with my family but even though things are better in the new place im still suicidal and i can't help but think maybe i haven't gotten over what happened there completely Sent from my SM-T210R using Tapatalk@@3
388@@ My life has been a mess to this point. I feel like killing myself, but not killing myself. Like, I don't want to die, I just want help that would come after a suicide attempt, if that makes sense. The reason I want this might seem silly to you, but it's really not to me. There is this boy. Let's call him ""Johnny"". I've been in love with Johnny for over a year, but Johnny doesn't love me back because I am not religious and I'm just overall not his obsession. Her name will be ""Jane"". Jane is perfect in his eyes. She's like a goddess I guess, and his obsession with her isn't healthy, even though they aren't dating. Well today, both Johnny and Jane made it onto the homecoming court, and I don't know why, but this triggered me so much. Jane is even going with a different boy, but it still upsets me greatly. I know this sounds like just an over-dramatic teenage girl being mad about nothing. Maybe it is. But Johnny is different to me. He's the only one who really knows about my self-harming habits, and he knows that I've been suicidal, take medication, and see a therapist. He knows I still love him and he tells me to just ""move on"". The thing is, I don't know how to ""move on"". My therapist genuinely thinks I am uncapable of moving on because I never learned the skill from my parents. I am an only child. But anyways, what Johnny doesn't know is that the thoughts of him are so intrusive. I've tried just about everything possible to get rid of them, and I feel like my only option is to just kill myself. But, that's not what I want. What I want is to put myself into a hospital to learn how to ""move on"". I need to find some sort of strategy I can apply to my situation to just make everything okay again. The thing is, I'm unable to do that. My therapist doesn't know about my thoughts because I'm unable to tell her. My dad has a history of suicide attempts and severe depression, and I know that if he finds out that I'm turning out to be like him, he'll try to kill himself. I can't tell my therapist about my self-harming or my thoughts because, by law, she has to tell my mom about it, and my mom never can keep her mouth shut, and she'll tell my dad. So I feel like I'm stuck and unable to get the help I need to see some sort of recovery. I also do not have many friends (I'm just that person you talk to in 4th hour or 1st hour or lunch or whenever) and the only person who really talks to me outside of school is Johnny, but it's usually me that starts the conversation and most of the time he responds with one word answers which convinces me that he hates me. I've never had a boyfriend before, because I think I come off as crazy to guys, and this kills my self esteem, because most guys don't even want to be friends with me. I don't have anyone to come check up on me either. Ive only hung out with people twice this year, and it's late September. The last time was the very beginning of the summer. I'm completely alone. I have lots if ambitions, such as graduating with honors and going to a big 10 college to major in psychology, but I can't see myself ever having a solid group of friends or boyfriend, because I've never in my life ever had any of these things. So things seem bleak for me, socially. But hey, on the bright side of this, not having a friend or boyfriend gives me time to focus on academics and art and music, right? If you're wondering about mental disorders I have to help cultivate your thoughts, I've been diagnosed with depression and currently taking 50mg of Zoloft daily. I have also been diagnosed with GAD and Phobia (which is too embarrassing to specify what the phobia is of) and I have been prescribed (I believe) .50mg of Xanax, which the school is currently keeping, however, they don't want to administer it to me for whatever reason. I also believe myself to have BPD, because I see that my thoughts and behavior line up almost perfectly with the symptoms and have been for the past couple years. I can relate to the experiences of other BPD sufferers, but I'm aware that a true diagnoses can't be made since I'm underaged and it may or may not be just hormones going out of control. Please, I need some advice. I'm at a loss and I don't think I'll be able to do anything to fix my situation so I might as well commit suicide anyways. Yes I've tried suicide hotlines several times in the past year and a half, but all they seem to do is push me away because I'm not in immediate danger of hurting myself and I just needed someone to talk to. Thanks for listening@@2
389@@ So, I'm new but don't want to introduce myself, I hope you understand. I'm having trouble finding advice, so I want to reach out to a Hive Mind of a kind. I am 33 and I suffer from severe depression, dysthymia (the dreaded ""double dip"" depression), and self-loathing. I've been evaluated professionally and see a therapist once a week. I've been on Celexa, Wellbutrin (that was BAD for me), Lexapro (which was great at first and then stopped working), and now Cymbalta...which appears to be somewhat effective. Here's where I'm at: I love my wife, and I love my son. I have a great relationship with my family and I have good friends. I have most of an MA and was a college teacher for a little while but it doesn't pay. My best year I made $15,000, and so I left that. I currently work full time for a shop that buys old aerial equipment , fixes it, and resells it. I was hired as a mechanic, and I was OK at it, but I was moved into the office after six months and now monitor online sales and am in charge of unethically modifying the computers to change the ""mileage"" on them. I also do marketing and sales. I loathe all of these things. I hate my job and am miserable every day. Some days, like today, I don't go to work because I simply can't stand it. I am at my wits end, I have been applying for jobs pretty much since the day I started int he office and have gotten only a few nibbles at minimum wage jobs. I make about twice that now... So what am I looking for? What should I do before I kill myself out of despair for an empty future? I have no future working for someone else, I know this, because I hate the idea of making other people rich at the expense of my self-respect. However, I'm unable to find a job to get me the heck out of there. I don't know what to do...most websites that offer ""find your passion"" advice don't help those of us with spouses and families. My wife and I bought a house earlier this year, and I can't afford to not have a job or take any time off for starting a business. Financially, we are fine, as long as I have a source of income significantly higher than minimum wage (at full time, no less). I don't know what to do. I wake up every weekday disappointed that I didn't die in my sleep. I yearn to die, I don't want my family to have the pain of knowing I was so selfish as to pass my pain to them. I have considered making my death look like an accident, but I don't think I really want to be dead...I just want to have a job I like that can support the lifestyle I want. Preferably, I'd like to work for myself somehow. Failing that, I'd like to go back to teaching...but I can't afford to. I just can't get over the fact that I don't want the life I have. I was so depressed for so long that I never bothered to make any decisions, especially hard ones. I sort of go along with what my wife wants...but I can't do that any more. I've been suicidal before, and have done the therapy and the drugs (like I am now), but I don't know if they're helping. I need help taking control of my life preferably without hurting my family. If I have to do that, I might as well kill myself since the pain's the same. TL:DR I'm in despair, have no hope, need more help.@@2
390@@ I am a 17 year old Junior in High school. I recently was kicked out of my old school, a private Christian school, when my ex girlfriend told the administrators that I was abusing substances. Not only did it kill me inside that she told on me (I really cared about her, she was one of the only people who ever really showed me affection and understood me) but it also killed me because afterward, I was viewed as the bad guy by everybody. Now, I am in a new school, with great friends. But, I am heavily abusing substances. I drink whatever I can get my hands on, including lean and alcohol. I sometimes smoke a lot of marijuana too. My grandparents are about to the point of giving up on me due to my poor decisions, and my acting out against them and acting like a maniac when they question me. I have struggled with depression for a while, and I have seen many therapists and a psychiatrist and have taken meds, but I can't seem to get straight. I really want to end it all, I don't know how yet, but I have ways. I hope I don't come off as attention seeking, but I really just want somebody's help. I want to know two main questions: 1. Why am I the bad guy? 2. Why do I suffer so much? 3. Will these hard times pass?@@4
391@@ A couple months ago my girlfriend said she was really depressed and went to the park and thought about killing herself for about an hour. I contacted our head licensed counselor at church via email and they got in touch with her. Last week, she started saying stuff like I want to kill myself and die so I started to get worried again. This time, I knew which counselor she was working with (one working on getting her license) so I emailed her. Didn't hear back from her, but this past Monday after she was done with her session, my girlfriend told me that the counselor showed her the email and said to tell me not to send her anymore emails. She said I can't tell him myself, so you will have to tell him for me. SERIOUSLY? The email was pretty basic and short message too and I have NEVER contacted her other than that one time! Ironically THAT DAY, the state issued her license, so I am seriously considering filing a complaint with the state, any thoughts on that? Obviously I am very frustrated and disgusted by what went on. PS. Girlfriend acknowledges and admits to making the statements about wanting to die, etc. b@@5
392@@ I am 19, and am sat planning, researching and doing everything I can to die without pain. It has got to that point where I have thought about the methods. I have done terrible things.  And I am not talking about small mistakes like losing a lover or what not.  Things I cannot forgive myself for and it has me guilty every single day and I cannot bare it.  I am not the victim I did this to myself but at the same time, i think what If I died and I regretted it? Be too late.  But at the same time I am petrified of living because of the mistakes I kept on making, and i hate it.  I never learned until it was too late, making the same sorts of mistakes over and over and over again.  For about four years. What do I do? My mistakes I have done could put my life in danger anyway with people wanting to kill me.  Torture me.   Plus, on the thought about love I left the only girl I loved because I was too stupid. Please note.  I will not tell anyone about my methods and do not encourage anyone in Suicide. Thank you everyone. Zach.@@1
393@@ I am 48 years old and have battle suicide ideation, clinical depression, and elements of Bipolar II since I was 15.  I have seen huge highs and successes in life, and lows of hell.  I was disowned by my family years ago, lost my first wife, most of my friends, and several careers over the years.  The past few years everything has gradually dwindled to what I am sure is approaching end. I have lost all stability and am now losing my second wife and my young son.  They are moving to SE Asia, where she is from.  I can barely walk because of a need for a knee replacement and suffer severe chest pains weekly now for 6 months.  I have no health insurance, but make too much money to qualify for help.  All of my income goes to paying off major debt.  I have been so a couple of free counseling places over the years, and tried atleast 15 different anti-depressants and mood stabilizers.....all to no avail. I don't have a single person to call, talk to, let alone ask for help or support.  I feel I have lived a full life already and experienced most things.  Now I have not one reason to keep fighting this dark pain and stay alive. Atleast 3 times a day I have to physically grab onto to something to keep from leaving my apartment and going to commit suicide. Some little sliver of light has kept me from doing it, and atleast come on to a forum like this...I need help and I don't know what to do... I've called hotlines a few times and that tides me over for a few hours...Several months back I want to the emergency room and asked for help.  After realizing I didn't have health insurance they placed me back in the lobby and call the police.  The system, society, people's hearts are all broken....I am asking for help from anybody and I have nobody.... I am sorry@@1
394@@ Yesterday I was EXTREMELY depressed.  So much that I was so sleepy that I could barely stay awake.  It's as if I was ready to lie down, fall instantly asleep, and wonder if I ever was going to wake up again. I wasn't exactly suicidal at that time -- although I see it becoming that if this continues. The only things that relieve this feeling are spending time on my computer, drinking sugar water (VERY bad although recent habit), and a little fun love play -- although my BF is leaving me unsatisfied in that regard. I've tried psych meds but they don't do a **** thing. Furthermore, I have no sense of being able to make my life better or persue my dreams any more. What a mess! Pat@@5
395@@ Even with a CPAP, I'm still wiped most days.  I'm also on vitamin D therapy, but so far nothing. Its just not worth living like this.  I just don't find anything in this world worth sticking around.  All I have to look forward to is more fatigue.@@3
396@@ Its 1:21 am as i am writing and its taken me since 11pm to even start writing anything. I know it seems long but this is a short version I tried to kill myself last week and dozens of times before that going back 8or9 years. Ive always been depressed although my family never noticed because i was typically good at avoiding them growing up and when they asked questions id make silly little excuses as to why i was in ""a mood"" as what they called it. It started when i was 13 my mom had always been very sick and she passed away that summer in 08. It took a toll on everysingle person that was in and out of our family whom knew her. That moment collapsed in the middle of the street in pjs crying my eyes out i knew id never be the same person again because at that moment it was already so deep. My dad sent me away for the summer to distract me from everything that had happened. The next school year I got into drugs and self harm, just hung with the wrong crowd;it got real my first year of high school, i got caught, at school cops ambulance and the phone call to my dad. I was grounded the whole 4 years i spent in that god for saken hell hole. The counselors tormented me,i was put into more therapy. I was miserable. 10 days after i graduated i moved states my dad disowned me along with most everyone in my family in fear they would recieve similar treatment. he was an abusive person but out of 10 kids biological and adopted i was the only kid that got it. He hid it from everyone and not a single person believed me. I got a new therapist as soon as i moved diagnosted with depression, an anxiety disorder, and they determined that i was suicidal. I already knew this but it was a condition to which was given to me by my brother in order to live with him and the girls. I moved out a year later then became homeless. I moved back onto my brothers couch and he put me back out onto the streets a month later because he didnt see an improvement although it was there. I have now been in this city for two years and i am trying so hard to do what i need to, to make myself a better person. Tonight im low as can be i received a very long text from said brother about how much of a screw up i am and that they could no longer be in my life. I try so hard so damn hard that i cant try anymore.  I am always there for EVERYONE yet no one is here for me.  Ive given up on trying to be happy  or even content with my life.@@2
397@@ ya so i went drinking yesterday because i was really stresed and unhappy. i know  i shouldnt do it but i did it because i am so stressed and unhappy and cant cope and im all alone so i decided it would be good ot get drunk. i dont do it very often so i felt li should give myself a break. felt great actually. didnt worry so much. but at night, i got really upset and started crying...tbh i think i would have cried anyway without the drinking because ive been wanting to cry just couldnt because i always found myself in public places. but i got so upset because i realized i was so alone in everything. and somehow i go to support groups that are mainly for depression,,,and im not depresed but there are no other support gorups available and i have no where else to goan i cant talk ot myfamily so i just go therre instead. and its just so bad because its like i go to meet ppl who i never met before and talk bout my problems and i cant talk to my family. i dont know if im making sense osmetimes i cant tlak right or get my main point across. and i hate beig alone and i cant cope with being alone. i keep telling msyelf when i feel better, that im okay its okay that mam isnt there for me its how she is and i need to move on and carry on somehow. and focus on me nad not hate her too much beause it odesnt help and it wont change things it wont change her. but i think it really hurts me when she keeps leaving when m upset or tell s me to go away becaue she cant cope with it and she cant even cope iwth her emotions because she just ignores them or she sleeps for hours. thats how she deals with it. and she lacks so much initiative she doesnt even try to do anything about it or improve herself. so when i got really upest and i was crying... actually been crying most days since i went back home haha its so annoying. it just hurt alot when she kept leaving i guess... like the last time i was crying for 2 mins and she got upset and couldnt deal with it so she just left and said there was no point in listening to me if i didnt listen to her. and i think it really upset me more than i thought because it realy hurt last night when i was crying. because i am so alone. and i go to a group thats not even entirely relevant because theres no where else ot go and i cant cope and people probably hae me there because one guy was challenging someoen else and asking if they really were depressed etc because tha tguy said they were bipolar. and he was saying ' this is a depression group' and it scared me becase its also for anxiety but mainly depression and i get anxious but not depressed but im not always anxious so i dont know. im weird. also i jsut figured. i think from about 5 till aabout 9 . i was dissociating alot. like i kept thinking i was dreaming, and i felt like i wasnt there. so even if i was upset or crying, for whatever reason. it didn matter because i wasnt there. and that annoys me because i thoght i had my whole life figured out. with my dad and stuff. and turns out i started having problems much much earlier than the previously thought 13 yrs old :( boooo. hopefully i wont hve any more surprises. dont like surprises. maybe its called derealization or something hrm. yeh.. ot thining so much about death now. but i guess i had a really bad phase last night. im not sure if its the drink. i been thinking really darkly anyways recently so. playing guitar ( and getting better!) helps i gess ok bye@@4
398@@ Last week I did a colleagues 1-2-1 where she informed me of some serious issues that where bothering her, I raised her concerns to the relevant person, I then had a conversation about her concerns with another colleague who is my equal at work so didn't see this being an issue. This was last Thursday. I turn up to work and am dragged into the office to be told I am being suspended because I breached confidently by telling the other manager, I am then told to go home and come back Tuesday for the outcome of the disciplinary. I turn up yesterday to be told I'm being demoted and having a written warning. Then told I can report back to work Wednesday as normal however I told them I need time to get my head straight which I feel is a fair request so will return Monday. I feel a criminal I was given the position with no training whatsoever, have constantly been told I was doing a good job to all this happening I was given less then 48 hours to prepare for my disciplinary was given no information on what I supposedly said since they said I had mentioned it to several people which is incorrect. Then in my actual disciplinary I was there for about 2 minutes and told your getting a demotion and a written warning with no impact on my pay I wasn't informed that I could appeal the decision just feels like they haven't managed it by the book, I don't know what to do because know they haven't followed disciplinary protocol but I don't want to jeopidse my job by complaining. I'm relieved I've been demoted as wasn't given a payrise for doing the role and was told pay wouldn't be reviewed till after a year, even though it meant longer hours and was near enough working 6 days straight so it does feel like a massive weight off my shoulders, I just feel like I have failed, not only the people who gave me the chance but also the colleague who raised her concerns to me, as I get the impression these will now be swept under the carpet! I'm dreading going back on Monday but I don't know what else to do and just feel like one option at the moment and that way I won't have any more issues whatsoever@@5

400@@ Havent been able to function lately.  Meds are making me sleepy about noon.  Then yesterday about 4 pm it knocked me out.  I fucking hate this life!! All I'm doing is existing, waiting for the end to come.  When my parents pass, things will be worse.  All my hopes, all my dreams....they are all out of reach for me.  My medicines all have bad side effects.  Neurologist said that I will always have a bad reaction cause of all the exposure to the different antipsychotics.  I am down to trying 2 different meds.....one is a last resort.  I am unsure what to do.  The specialist said to stay on my current medication and take the muscle relaxers, cause if I switch meds I'll get tardive dyskinesia and tardive dystonia anyway.  My psych just keeps asking do I want to try a different med?  I feel like I'm the fucking doctor with no guidance!  Fuck this life, I dont want it anymore!@@4
401@@ I never really thought I would be in this situation. Sure I have been in plenty similar in the past, but this time it's different. I am suicidal. There is no denying it. For some reason, people in my life don't want me to go down this path My parents are literally babysitting me (I'm 25). It's funny because I haven't said a word to them, they don't really know what is going on, they can only guess. I guess that they are guessing right though, or at least just expecting the worst. There's a long story behind this which I'm not really willing to get into, but my mum got the mental health team involved, and as I have refused to cooperate I think I am about to be sectioned. It really does suck when you realise your plan isn't going to work out, when you put so much effort into it working out. People just seem to get in the way. I never really thought I would be in this situation. Silly me thought that I could go along with what I wanted and no one would stop me. Note to self...hide it better in future!@@3
402@@ I've had this very deep feeling for about two years now, that I do not want to live anymore. I feel no sorrow of it. I'm an 30 years old guy, I just feel that i've seen enough. I feel that my life and future would be endurable and boring at best. And I am not talking about giving up, just being realistic. I am just so tired and bored trying to make anything out of nothing. Maybe four times a week I wake up and ask myself the question, still here..? Even at times I feel somewhat of joy or something.. I say to myself that it's false. So those good moments and feelings are getting scarcer day by day. My life, I believe, would be valuable only to my parents, and to a one good friend, but for me not so much. I'd really hope to outlive my parents, that's one of the few reasons that keeps me going on, but I don't know.. Though I know, I could get through these black clouds, for a while at least, but I also know they would come back anyway. It would be so much easier just to stop living now, than to keep convincing myself that everything will be good, which would never happen.@@4
403@@ This isnt the best post to start with but i feel i should let it all out. Please dont say anything mean or rude to me, it wont help me any better. this isnt a goodbye, just venting this is also very long. I'm Libra and my life has been awful to me. I constantly think and try to kill myself. Now before you say, ""youre only 15! life has so much to offer!"" it doesnt for me. I wasnt even meant to be born. Im the result of my mother having an affair with another man and my supposed to be father was never happy about that. With that, you can tell that my mother isnt a good person, shes abusive towards me. My parents stayed together, but fought constantly until my dad died when i was 7. From that moment on, ive had several different men come home and call themselves my dad. I lived my whole life never knowing what its like to have a dad. I guess i have daddy issues, if you want to say that. Ive been able to deal without having a dad because I had two older brothers. (Oldest was 38, 2nd was 16) We all got along and we loved each other a lot. This was until this year when the month of my birthday, the oldest one killed himself and eventually the 2nd one was taken off of life support in April. Since then, my mther hits and yells at me contantly and I was left all alone and i have no one to rely on. I had a lot of friends but soon eventually left me for people better. The only 3 friends i have left, dont have time to talk so its not like i know anyone to talk to. I have a boyfriend yes, but i dont trust him as much as i did anymore. He told me he started falling in love with a friend of his, and although hes still with me, im in constant worry he'll leave me for her. I want to kill myself so badly, I have no one to live for and no reason to be here anymore. Please dont tell me i shouldnt die because life gets better, ive told myself this but it has only gotten worse. Telling me to not give up for my dreams is useless, since i dropped out of school because i know i will become nothing when im older. I truly hate every moment of my life and i wish i could take my own life.@@1
404@@ Right now I'm crying all alone in my room. I don't think I'll sleep tonight. Too much pain and worry. I haven't slept normally for so long. I'm all alone in life. I don't have any friend or girl who loves me. Nothing changes. Nothing ever changes. Recently something terrible happened to me which triggered all this but I don't want to discuss it as it'll only make me feel worse. I feel so hopeless at this point. Like my life is vanishing before my eyes. Like my entire life was nothing more than a lie. All I ever wanted was to just be wanted and cared for. To just be a normal person. I don't want to die but what if I go too far and actually kill myself? Who will care? Nobody. How sad is that? How sad is it that even if I killed myself no person would actually care. It would affect nobody. No person would actually need me or miss me. Why? Why does it have to be this way for me? I'm not a bad person. I never hurt anyone and this is how life is for me. I don't want to die alone but that is what is exactly going to happen to me at this rate. All I want is to just be normal like everybody else. To just have a girl who actually loves me and I love too. Someone I can spend the rest of my life with and friends who actually care about me. Not to be miserable in this fucking house all alone every day. Please anyone just please give me any advice on what to do. I've never been at a lower point in my life and I really need someone right now. Anyone. Please@@3
405@@ I am just really badly feeling now. :( Again my suicidal feelings have rose up :( It seems that every argue i have creates this feeling in me :/ I am crying for 15 mins now without stopping :( I dont know why i am writing this....@@3
406@@ Hi, I am probably not like most of the guys here, I was born abnormal physically and because of this I cannot live a normal life, I also suffer from being stupid, bad memory, bad digestive system, bad immune system. I cannot get married have kids live happily ever after. I do not wish to live, I am not in a mad rush but I wish to leave quick easy simply painlessly, I don't believe I deserve to die a painful death. I have just now and wil continue to research suicide and find a easy way. Me I want to live, I would love to get married etc, but I am abnormal since day one I don't blame myself I was born with defect that is main reason for suicide, its sick so I wont state it. I do have emotional social issues, and believe it or not I am being attacked by demonic entities or a curse which attack me physically (yes I know never knew it was possible) emotionally they can put me in emotional meltdown and mentally its like some one constantly chatting shit in your head. They use ""we are testing you"" to try destroy me. I am a spirituall person, I learned spiritual healing and meidtations to help better my health and it did work to an extent until this evil came into my life. I am a reiki healer and this evil can stop reiki, I am also able to do different spiritual healing methods which BTW work but this evil cant stop this too. This demonic attack isn't reason for my suicide, infact is quite opposite I wont let them make me kill myself I want it to be my decision. I had spiritual visions eg saw hindu gods etc which now I believe was this evil as it used these visions to put me threw hell and continues too. Please don't get me wrong im not mad, or bad, Just have defect that cant see me live a normal life, that plus certain other issues makes living life hell. I would love to find the one fall in love, live happily ever after but cant.@@3
407@@ It hits like a fucking truck. Like a vortex that has only one goal of taking you whole but you hold your ground. My strength is fading fast there's only so much one person can endure and endure alone. I'm always being used, people making me feel wanted and loved only to be thrown out like a old used rag when I'm not wanted anymore. Theirs no point in hate anymore, just the hope of relief when my life is snuffed out. Fuck everyone else. At least then I don't need to feel just pain. Or the worse feeling of having hope, confidence, and trust, along with the elation of just radiating self-worth and happiness only to have it ripped out from under you to feel useless and worthless.@@3
408@@ what is it about me that makes me such as loser? What is it so bad about me that makes nobody want anything to do with me? I really want to know the truth. If I kill myself I want to know this much at least. Why am I such garbage?@@4
409@@ lately I haven't been having a good time with my family or ""fiance""/ i say fiance lightly because he hasn't been acting like one. Everything is all happening at one time and I really don't know how to react and I feel as though I'm ready to give up and just not have to deal with this anymore. My fiance and I live with his parents, they don't want me to live with them anymore because of financial reasons, they say they can't afford me to live here. I'm a little hurt because they know I don't have anywhere to really go, no family or friends. Being my FIANCE I thought he would A) stand up for me, B) move out into own place or C) help me find a place to live. He's done none of those.... what kind of person just throws you out if they love you? our original plans were to move out with 2 of his friends into a small apartment and we'd split rent. His parents got angry and told him he has to stay because he can't go to school & also work for the rent............ He was convinced and decided to stay with his parents for his education but afterwards would come live with me. I have no where to go and asked my parents (ha what a joke). I'm 19, barely 19 at that, and was kicked out by my mom when I was 18. My dad said since January I could come live with him but every time I ask for details or for when I will be able to he comes up with some excuse why not. My sister quit her job and lives with her boyfriends mom. My mom lives in her friends basement. I asked them all for help, THE ONLY TIME IVE EVER FRICKEN ASKED, and they all turned me down. My dad promised I could move in with him and yet won't let me. I left my dads a few years ago because of my depression, I confided in him about my thoughts of suicide, showed him everything I had gathered to commit it and told him about my savings account and how I was saving to get the rest of the materials. I told him this after hours and hours of him yelling at me about how I wasn't normal and that I need to tell him whats wrong so he could help me. So I told him. His reaction was to YELL at me and THREATEN me with the hospital. Telling me how everyone would think I was crazy and I was gonna get help for being crazy. I moved away after that. The other day I was asking him when to move in and he once again put it off another 2-3 months. I told him I didn't have that long and he stood by the reasoning of ""settling my sister into college"". You can't give me a place to stay, a couch or a floor to sleep on while you also drive my sister to her university next month??? I went off, told him how much he has always neglected me, how I forgave him for the abuse in my childhood and that forgivness is something so special and he's throwing it away, told him that he never once called during my stay in the mental hospital and how much that hurt, or that when I went to visit my sister who lived with him he wouldn't even go out to dinner with me and SOOOO much other things. My sister who lived with me at the time, is bi-polar with schitzophrenic tendicies, and I took care of her during her episodes and I told him that he wasn't there and he never was and I needed him. When I had to testify in court against my rapist, I needed him. And when my mothers husband tried to hurt me and I begged for my dad to come get me, he wasn't there. I was crying so hard while telling him these things. I apologized the next day for being so harsh and have tried to call him and text him for over a week and he's flat out ignored me. My finacee has been cheating on me, my mom has been yelling at me and flat out ignoring my attempts to talk to her (ive forgiven her because she said she's getting help and changing) and my dad has been ignoring me and putting me on the back burner for so long. THEY ALL KNOW I AM SUICIDAL! It seems like they're wanting me to commit suicide at this point. Knowing I have tried multiple times in the past, knowing I am very vulnerable now, knowing I am standing on this edge, they still keep pushing.... I need a family, I need love and simply a hug. Yet constantly, I'm pushed away like I've done something wrong. Like I'm the plague. I don't know what to do anymore. In therapy they tell you how much you need friends and family to help you through your depression and I have absolutely no one and feel so alone. SOO alone. I've been thinking about it so much lately and at this point, and after today, I'm thinking of just throwing in the towel. My mom hasn't talked to me in over 4 months, and yet she calls my sisters everyday. My dad has been ignoring me for almost a week and yet he calls my sisters every day...... my fiance basically picked school over me, this is supposed to be the man that loves me.... and i tell him all the time how much this terrifies me. i'm scared I'll leave and never see him again. that this is his way of breaking up with me because if he really didnt wanna be seperated for so long he would be on the same page as me with getting out on our own so we can be together. I understand going to school and having a job will be hard but I'd be doing it too and I'd be okay with it because I love him and it's worth it. Why is it not the same for him? He can't go through a few hard months if it means I'll have a place to live??? :( I already feel hopeless, and worthless as it is. I already have these feelings of loneliness and complete isolation from the world. And they all don't care. They're adding onto these feelings. Validating their existence every single day. I feel so worthless. My fiance cheated on me and it made me feel so low, and stupid. Like it was all somehow my fault. Like i wasn't good enough, and I'm not. Something is obviously wrong with me because if there wasn't, why does everyone treat me like this? Its obviously me. I'm worthless and can't ever do anything right. No one cares and no one ever will. How am I supposed to feel loved and important when people keep throwing me away???@@2
410@@ Hi everyone, Apologies for the first time message without introduction, but I'm trying to work out feelings of suicide that I've been having this week. I've been reading the forums but still not managed to straighten out anything in my head. The symptoms in my neck are gone, but yesterday my left arm was having a spasm.  That's never happened before.  I have dystonia and tardive dyskinesia, it's difficult to talk and chew, plus my arm slouches and is stiff.  I can't keep living like this, I just can't do it anymore.@@5
411@@ Is it normal (bad choice of word, I know) to be quite happy with the idea of taking my own life whilst at the same time making plans for the longer term? I've been depressed for a while but this week it has been pretty bad. In fact, the only thing that gets me to sleep is looking up ways to die and knowing that I can do that if I can't handle it any more. In a weird way...it's peaceful. I know exactly how I will do it, and where in the house, and that it won't fail. It feels like something I'm looking forward to. But at the same time I'm arranging to do things that occur a long time from now. I've only been able to do that since I had this ""fail safe"" option in my head though. Like...either one would make me happier than I am now. I've thought about it on and off for a while, but never actually planned it fully, and never gained any comfort from it. Apologies for the rambly way of putting this. It took quite a bit of alcohol to build up the courage.@@2
412@@ Been in a good place for a long time, possibly longest time of my life. Until last week. As with depression there are ups and downs and I have learned to deal with them. This time though, its situational. I think that makes it worse. Mainly because it was entirely preventable. The situation will go one of two ways. Minimal damage but damaging none the less or maximum damage. The latter is more likely and the most scary. It literally has the potential to decimate many lives. I cant eat, sleep or function properly. This effects my entire family and they are turning to me for answers I cannot possibly give them. All I can do is sit and wait and it is literally killing me. I feel sick. I cannot envisage anything being ok after this. My second chance is gone. I am toxic. I wish I was never born.@@5
413@@ First off I wanna apologies for run on sentences that will probably have no direction or make much sense I'm just typing as things come to mind so bare with me. I used to pride myself with the fact that nothing in life would ever be able to break me I thought I was too mentally tough to let that happen but that day has finally come. I've been completely alone and have had nothing for years and I was able to shrug it off and not worry and just focus on working at my job, i knew in the back of my head that being alone was getting to me but I figured if I ignore it it'll go away, I purposely avoided interaction with people when possible for years until recently I met a girl where I work who I had my eye on but kept my distance and then she kept talking to me and slowly I started talking to her more and more and then I asked her out and we had dinner together and it was then when it hit me HARD just how lonely I really am, we've gone out twice now and I really like her a lot but I'm not sure if she feels the same way / she might be moving to a different state. Now I'm not complaining about a girl what my problem is I'm just sick and tired of constant disappointment in my life, I didn't realize how much of my sanity has gone away from being stuck within myself for so long. I went from not caring about having anything to having borderline panic attacks from fear of being by myself any longer it's worse than death, I go to bed every night begging and praying I don't wake up the next day and wake up in the morning wondering if today's the day, I fight the urge to do it 24/7 but I'm not sure how much fight I've got left. I realize I'm pathetic and a loser but it just seems whenever I find someone or something to give me motivation to keep going it quickly goes away and maybe this is just proof I've lost it but I swear god or something is doing this to me as a joke. I know there's people who have it way worse than me but this is just a weight I can't carry anymore the constant reminder that I have absolutely no one is terrifying to me now. I can handle the rest of lifes burdens but I'm just finding myself begging to have at least someone, It scares the living hell out of me to feel solitude drive me to insanity. I honestly can't think of much more to say other than I know how pathetic I look and sorry if this post is hard to follow.@@4
414@@ So what I'm going to write is probably going to be very long and hard to write but at this point I have nowhere to turn anymore. Nobody to talk to about this. Nobody who cares about me that can actually help me. This has been the worst time of my life that I can ever remember. Never in so long have I been this bad. I'm at one of the lowest points in my entire life and I feel so horrible every single day. Please don't say anything mean or bad. As it will only make me feel worse as it is. I need support. I need someone right now. So now I'm going to try to explain what has happened and what had brought me to this point.its going to be long and hard to write but I have to. I'm crying while I type all this. So basically I was extremely lucky to meet the most wonderful person I ever had the fortune of knowing. When we first met she was always there for me every day. :( the only person who would be there for me. The only person who ever truly cared about me. My best friend in the world. After I got my phone we started texting on it every day. I love her so much and she loved me too as a friend. I wouldn't trade her for the world. We were so happy together and I was so happy too. Yet disgustingly enough I took my life for granted. A mistake I will never repeat again. I would always help her when she needed me and she would always. Always be there for me. When my grandparents died and I was left alone she was the only person who cared about me and was there for me. She's not a bad person. Not at all. She tried to convince me many times that life is worth living when I was suicidal. Nobody has ever cared that much for me and I took it all for granted like a stupid piece of shit. So we talked to each other every day. Every morning she would be there and message me and every night she would tell me ""good night"" give me a hug and I would go to sleep happy and peacefully. If I didn't reply for even an hour she would get so worried. She would start to cry and panic because she was afraid something would happen to me. I was paranoid at times. I would question her almost every day and ask her if she really cared about me or not. I would say things like ""you don't really care about me do you?"" Or ""do you really even care about me?"" And EVERY time she had to reassure me that she DID care so much. It had gotten so bad that I would ask her over and over again almost every single day.  I know that she's a wonderful person so I'm trying to be fair. Eventually I started falling in love with her. She already had a boyfriend however long before we met and she was in a very happy relationship with him. She loved him so much and she wanted to marry him. Looking back on it I see how wrong it was of me to be doing this to her when she was already happily in love with someone else. It was immoral of me and I shouldn't have but let me continue my story. So eventually I did confess my love for her. She told me she couldn't because she was already devoted to someone and that she wishes she could but she wouldn't  be  able to return those feelings to me because she was already with someone. I let it go at the time but this would only get worse later on. At this point things were amazing. I was happy in life for the first time in years. I told her to promise me that she would always be my friend and to give me her word she would never leave me. She gave me her word and she told me she would never leave me and that I could trust her. I took that trust and I trusted her. At this point of my life things were never better. I had an amazing best friend that nobody in the world could ever replace. My self esteem was much better than it had ever been in years. And I was genuinely happy. But most of all I had an amazing supportive person who was there for me every day. Things were improving so much. I was looking forward to a great future and for the first time things were finally getting better and going right. Looking back on it that time with her was one of the most happiest moments of my life. I still remember so many special moments that we shared together that can never be replaced by anyone. If only I had acted differently at that time I would never be in this place today. Continuing with my story as time went on things started getting bad. I started getting jealous of her partner and would constantly ask her about being with me and even get angry. I started getting too personal with her and her relationship. It was then for the first time she actually considered leaving me. I was shocked. I couldn't believe it. How could she actually say that? How could she actually say she would leave me? ( This was only the FIRST time she contemplated leaving me. However this would continue many times in the future as I will mention). I had to beg her not to. Not because of being alone. No far from it. At that time I had many other friends and girls I talked to but NONE could ever come close to her or even match her. But because she was special to me. She was the most important person in my life and there really isn't anyone else on earth I would rather be with. She didn't leave but she warned me that if I did it again then she would leave. I promised I wouldn't. It was at this point I think that things really started going downhill. It was nowhere as near as bad as it would get later on. So we continued talking normally every day. As usual she would be there every morning and say good night to me every single night. I think about her every day. Somewhere around this time when I was having my usual paranoia I was questioning her if she really cared about me or not. It was this time she said ""you mean the world to me"". That really touched me because nobody had ever cared that much about me before. She told me I would always be important to her and countless times I asked her to promise me she will always be my friend for the rest of my life. She promised every time and said ""I'll always be your friend"" and she wasn't lying. She meant it. She never lied to me. Not once when we were together did she ever lie. At one point of time things were so good between us I thought to myself "" there is no way I'll ever lose her, we care about each other way too much"". then my paranoia only got worse and my jealousy and anger as well. I would start to question her almost daily. Asked her if she really cared about me or not. She always  reassured me that she did care and she wasn't using me. I was paranoid and jealous. I kept asking her if she was talking to other people but she wasn't. I would get angry and call her names including ""Bitch"" She told me I was paranoid and needed to trust her. This viscous cycle went on for months and it only got worse. I really damaged her life badly because of it. Her grades in college were declining because of me, it was damaging her health, and I was only making her depression worse. She probably suffered so much because of me and I probably put her through so much pain. Yet she still remained with me despite all that because she cared about me so much. It only got worse later on. I would start to cuss at her and be abusive, accusing almost every single day. She gave me many many warnings that this was becoming a toxic friendship for her and if I kept acting this way she would have to leave and many times she almost did leave but again I begged her not to leave and I made promises that I would change. She never left and always forgave me every time but I repeated the same stupid fucking mistakes again and again. Then one incident just made our friendship even worse. It was when I told her I loved her again and she got mad at me for it. She told me she would never see me that way and to stop feeling that way towards her because she has a partner. That was the day I called her something very offensive and I think it really hurt her a lot ever since and that's the day I think she wasn't sure she wanted to stay anymore. By some miracle she still stayed with me even though I called her all those very bad things. At this point things really started getting bad. I would get paranoid every single day and we were doing more arguing than anything else. I would be abusive to her every day and it wasn't looking good. So one night she replies to me and I read it but couldn't reply because I was sleepy. When I woke up I didn't get a response from her as I always do so I got angry with her. She told me I didn't reply so it wasn't her problem. This made me cuss at her again and start saying more offensive things to her. This was the day I think she just decided ""enough was enough"" and she couldn't handle the negative influence I had on her life anymore so she said to me: "" I don't want to be friends anymore, it's just too much"" and blocked me for the first time ever. I was panicking and in shock I never actually took her seriously that she would actually leave me. I NEVER thought she would actually leave me but she did. I was warned many times but I didn't listen@@4
415@@ new here.. I have fought for so long with my mind, i have surrendered.. i'm too tired to keep on fighting.. I WANT to do it, but the only thing stopping me is a promise i made to my husband.. but that is really really hard to keep to it now. I have tried before twice but was unsuccessful..@@2
416@@ Nobody cares about me, nobody to talk to every day, no life. I just can't bear it anymore. It's too much. I will probably die alone and nobody will even care. I just can't it's too much, I'm lonely and nobody cares about me@@4
417@@ So I couldn't even tell my Mom ""Happy Mother's day"" because every year I always feel guilty about not being able to do enough for her. I suffer from a disability that prevents me from doing more elaborate things like taking her out to dinner or breakfast. I can't hold a job because of this disability. So I can't buy her anything. Every year it's the same thing. I just end up making her a card and she seems to appreciate it, but it's just not enough to me. I always have to watch my other guy friends do much better stuff for their Moms. I couldn't tell her ""Happy Mother's day"" yesterday because just saying the words would remind me of why I can't do anything for her. Just saying it would make me feel suicidal and want to kill myself because I feel like I'm not a good enough son for her. I put the words inside of a card but I had to force myself to do that. I just feel ashamed. She does so much for me and I can't do as much for her. She's the main reason why I'm suicidal...because I feel like she deserves better and if I can't give her that as a son why should I live?@@4
418@@ Hey, Gravi here waiting until I say something stupid enough to get me banned. Give me a week. I'm an old man (32) and have been suicidal to various degrees for 18 years. Whether you call what I tried a few years ago a suicide attempt, well, that's your call. Basic idea, I'm an old man. I've always been waiting for the promised day when things would get better. You know, the day where I find my people at least to the point of not being completely isolated. I used to believe that it would get better someday: middle school will suck, but high school will be better. Believe when the family says that. High school will suck, but college will be better. Believe that too. Oops, didn't get into a good one, but the top-tier one transferred into after a year will be better. Huh, nope, all the same. I guess grad will be better, as I've been told. Nope, time to give up and drop out. So after the whole list here I'm back with living with my parents, at least 50 grand in the hole for college, and unemployable at 32 (a math/physics bachelor's with some grad math and multiple upper-division comp sci classes isn't enough to get a job at warehouses or Price Chopper, evidently) and always hearing from my family and psychiatrist that I'm more or less a leeching piece of shit (yes, I get called a leech by my psychiatrist despite the fact that I put in a bunch of job apps and those three employment agencies aren't panning out) and that it's this horrible, selfish thing to ever think that I should ever not be miserable. You know, as my psychiatrist said, nature doesn't care if I'm always unhappy so I should just suck it up and live with the fact that I'm miserable all the time, or as my dad says nobody is ever happy until retirement, so it's 30 years minimum (probably 45+) before I'm looking at any sort of satisfaction with life... I'm sorry, I'm just being whiny at this point, half due to being a pathetic little bitch and half due to being drunk (only reason I'd drop by a forum like this instead of spending my night wondering if now is the time). I've picked up drinking lately, especially since it seems those nice little drugs for OCD and depression are doing exactly nothing. I've stopped taking them entirely, but...the funny thing is I feel no different. It's always looking pretty damn dark. The lie was always made that someday it would be better, but now everybody's just dropping all their pretenses and saying flat-out that I need to shut up and just live life this way forever. This can't happen. So yeah, I'm in kind of a perpetual crisis state right here... Sorry again for being a little whiner.@@4
419@@ Literally, the only thing keeping me going is my pride. At this moment in time my pride won't let me kill myself because I don't want the people I leave behind to think I was weak but my pride won't let me take medication for my various disorders or claim disability. However I have done extensive research on CBT and DBT techniques. I'm too fucked up to live a normal life but I'm sane enough to realize just how different I am when I'm with other people and envision the kind of life I could of had if things were slightly different. For the next couple next months it really is make or break time so to speak. I am literally willing to clean toilets in order to start making a bit of money again (I've lost count of the number of cleaning jobs I've applied for) Every man has his breaking point, I think I may be very close to mine.@@4

I JUst dont know what to do anymore to stop feeling like this .@@3
421@@ A few years back I lost my job due to back problems, I have spinal stenosis coupled with 2 bulging disks. That combined with the fact that for the previous 10 years I had been a truck driver so my back was taking a beating while being seated and unmoving for such long periods of time cause the muscles in that area of my back to atrophy. It started slowly I found I was in pain when I had to stand or walk for more than few minutes, but instead of taking time off of work to get it checked I simply reduced how much i stood or walked in order to keep working. This facilitated a nasty cycle where the less I did the more weight I gained, the more weight I gained the more pain I was in so I did less. Eventually I could no longer perform the required tasks for the job and had to leave, I had disability insurance and that kicked in because the doctors stated I could no longer do the job. Doctors that I went to took the approach of pain management and instead focused on my weight, they were sure that i had heart problems, so sure that even when a stress test came back fine they still order a heart cath. The doctor that performed the procedure said that I had the heart of a teenager, nothing wrong. Doctors still could only see my weight when i went to them and ignored my back, they went so far as to order me physical therapy which was a miserable failure, it put me in so much pain that for every day I spent doing it i spent 2 days unable to do much more than sit in pain and not move. By this time i no longer had medical coverage but since i am a veteran the VA covers me for that but their care is more of the same, manage the pain (100mg of Tramadol 4 times per day, 1600mg methocarbamol 4 times per day 30mg meloxicam twice a day). This has gone on over the past 3 years, during this time I lost the relationship that I had been in for the last 10 years including the 2 kids of hers that I considered my own, I lost my license and vehicle because I didnt have the money to keep the vehicle nor the energy/inclination to renew the license, and was forced to move. Through it all I had been being supported by the small monthly check I get from the disability insurance, they also started my disability claim which has been turned down twice because they state that I can still work if I do so seated, they fail to take into account that with exception of a recliner at the house that I have cushions duct taped in the perfect places I can not sit in any other chairs for more than 15-20 min before the pain gets to be bad enough that I need to move. I dont sleep well either, 2-3 hours max at a time before the pain wakes me up and i have to go sit in the recliner, so my days are a constant cycle of sleep until pain is more than i can sleep through then sit up until the exhaustion out weighs the pain. The disability company retained a law firm that specializes in disability claims and they have gotten me a hearing for my appeal. This brings me to now, I live in a house with a roommate, he helps as he can with taking me places when he isnt working, the house is rural so no public transportation is available, I am about a month out from my hearing and stressing out over it cause I fear if it is denied then my source of income will go leaving me homeless and hopeless. Having spent the majority of the past 15 years on the road doing long haul trucking the only friends I have are online ones in far away places and family is not an option for help, all of this has me thinking about an exit strategy to end the pain, suffering and stress.@@4
422@@ Things seem to always go from bad to worse for me. My disorder is getting much worse. I am depressed and quite suicidal. I used to talk with my mom everyday but those conversations are always a broken record since I am so miserable. I have been seeing my therapist for several years and I got the feeling in our last session that she did not want to see me anymore because she does not know how to help me. At times during the session she was quite short with me and she has never acted that way in the 3 or so years I have been seeing her. SO I am thinking I am done with therapy. I do not want to have a different perspective to my disorder. It has ruined every aspect of my life. I feel quite abandoned by my treatment team because they do not know how to treat this. I am alone in all this. I don't understand why nothing has worked to help this. I do not understand why people can't understand why suicide would be on my mind. I live a miserable existence each and every day. Why is it acceptable to just buy time until I die? My sentence because of this disorder feels like I am in prison without the possibility of parole....I just want the death sentence. When I first became suicidal when I was 26, I bought into people telling me it will get better....wellll I am soon to be 35 it has gotten much much worse.@@4
423@@ Really just pondering what the point of all this is I have a week off work and I'm already crawling up the walls, with nothing but my thoughts for company which is quite dangerous, just seems I live for work and nothing else, I'm ready to explode I've been going cinema and dinner with a girl recently granted I work with her and I drive her to and from work as well but it's nice to kick back and chill with her now and again only problem is she knows I have a massive crush on her but she has a boyfriend who's a waster and doesn't work, I really like her but know she won't leave him for me yet when it does go wrong I'm the mug she will come running to! We are meant to be going out Wednesday to catch a movie but I'm not going to be the one to make the move and still check we are going I'm gonna see if she remembers, granted I'll be pissed if she don't message me but on the other scale I hope she does as I just want to say I've made other plans get your boyfriend to take you. I'm tempted to wait for it to go wrong and be there for her when it does but I don't know why I'm wasting my time, it's happened before but it was worth the wait as me and my ex it was a good few years it just wasn't meant to be its dÃ©jÃ  vu, but then sitting here with my thoughts I'm just thinking fuck it if i go I won't be missed@@3
424@@ I apologize in advance for being so detailed. From the time I was 16, I knew something was ""wrong"" with me. I would check out books from the library trying to diagnose myself. I wasn't depressed but I would go through periods of isolating, to wanting to be with friends and having fun and laughing, and then back to isolating and avoiding people. It confused a lot of people through the years, and now everyone's sick of it and I have nobody (I'm not 39). I was lonely when I didn't spend time with friends, and yes depressed. But never suicidal. I'm still scared as can be of dying. I never understood the idea of suicide. Until not long after my 33 birthday. I had been struggling with depression for 2 years by then, very severe depression to the point I couldn't work and was barely functioning. Never suicidal until February 2009. I had my first inpatient experience in March 2011. Another in October that year. 2012 was bad. I went inpatient 8 times (one involuntary) plus a stint at a state institution. Altogether I spent approximately 67 days hospitalized that year. I was hospitalized twice in quick succession in Jan/Feb 2013. I have not been hospitalized since. I've had so many dx I don't know what to think. I believe it's Bipolar 2. GAD. ADHD (only dx given to me after an actual evaluation). I did have a period between Nov-March this year where I was behaving in what I would call a hypomanic state and I'm too embarrassed to go over the details. But I wasn't depressed so I didn't go to the hospital. Now I'm depressed. I don't know what happened. Back when I was being hospitalized a lot, I lived alone. i had no responsibilities. I WAS alone. I was lonely. Now, I take care of my 25 year old sister who has developmental issues, as well as her 7 year old son. I don't do anything more than anyone would for a family member. I could be doing more. And usually I am fine with the responsibilities I have (we also have pets). The last week or so it's suddenly become suffocating, I feel like I'm being crushed under the weight of this responsibility and I don't know why. Nothing changed. I've been doing this a year and a half. I feel like I can't take it and I want to leave then I think about the mess that would create for my sister and nephew (I raised my sister, she's practically my daughter). And how I would feel so selfish, knowing that because I'm weak I destroyed their lives. I don't want to be around to see it. if I can't do it, I don't have a reason for living anyway. Everything seems magnified. Little things feel big. I feel so much anger and I don't know why. I just know it's taking a lot of reminding myself I don't want to die, i just DONT WANT TO FEEL THIS WAY, to keep me from a method that would be infallible. It would be so quick. I can't take care of myself and all these responsbilities. I finally found someone who said they'd come stay so I can go get help. I spent 3 hours putting together specific instructions on what needs to be done, (rent is due this weekend), and I still feel like I'm failing them. And I wonder what will happen when I'm gone. i have a cat with severe asthma. What if he has a crisis? What if I forgot to put something in the instructions that's really important? I'm so selfish, to leave. And that makes me feel even worse. I should be able to work through this without getting help in a hospital but I know I can't. I've been down this road before. I know where it leads. I started writing my goodbye letters. I started planning what to do with my stuff, what to throw out, what to keep and who to send it to. It wouldn't be an impulsive act; it would have to be deliberate. There are a lot of things to tend to. But the more I think about it, and plan it, the more I become convinced it's the best answer. So I'm going impatient but I am so worried it wont' help. I can't explain why I feel this way. nothing has changed. My responsibilities are the same. They are not overwhelming usually. I did have an incident where I experienced sudden extreme pain out of nowhere that lasted a week and was excruciating. The doctors didn't take it seriously. i got a garbage can fibromyalgia dx. And the pain was gone in a week but not before I fell asleep while driving and hit a median and destroyed my car (with my nephew in the backseat). I am horrified at what could have happened. I was also taken off my adderall for my ADHD, I've been on stimulants for 8 years. My psych left and I had to find a new one, and she dug up a record from one doctor during one of my hospitalizations who said I have some schizoid thing going on (no other doctor has ever suggested that) as her reasoning for taking me off. But I talked to a patient advocate who admitted they're basically taking every adult off stimulants at that clinic whether there's cause or not. I also had my Ambien reduced from 20 mg (which is definitely high but it's the only thing that works) to 10 mg and that doesn't work. I have to take my clonazepam with it, which means I go without my clonazepam during the day. Or I go without sleep. Anyway those changes were in May so that can't be why this is happening. I don't understand it. I feel so weak. My sister is upset with me, disappointed. She says I should just make myself feel better. She threatened to quit her job if I left, but I found my brother to come take my place while I'm gone. But I don't have much support. I feel like a worthless human being, I can't even take care of the people I love without it being too much. But I can't survive alone either.@@4
425@@ I just tried chatting on the suicide prevention line. It went no where. They guy had nothing to say to me, I guess because I had nothing to say to him. Are the people on the phone this unresponsive? It's my own fault. I can't talk to anyone about my depression. I try talking to my family and they have nothing to say. I'm incapable of forming real relationships with people, so I don't have any friends. I finally blew up and posted a facebook rant about my depression a couple months ago. I got a few supportive words from people that live 3,000 miles away, and nothing since. This is me. I'm just going to suffer in silence forever then kill myself.@@4
426@@ I have to look forward to more sickly days isolated from people who once meant the fucking world to me and from people might be able to mean the world to me.  More sickly days because I'm too fucking cowardly to do myself in.  Because nobody wants to put up with someone with this many anxiety disorders in their life.  And because I don't have the time or resources to take anymore meaningful steps in any direction but downwards.  The internet doesn't help.  Platitudes from strangers doesn't help.  The only thing that has ever helped, that ever has a chance at helping again, is the thing I'm not fucking allowed to have.  I merely bide my fucking time until the fear of ""failing"" is dwarfed by the mounting anxiety/depression getting worse and fucking worse every goddamn day.@@3
427@@ hiiiii just wanted to do a report on the last week or so.. hope thats okay . i iwanted to do a report cos i couldnt go to my support group today. apart from the ridiculous commuting, i found out last night (after going for over a year) that it was a depression support group...for some reason i musta seen the word 'anxiety' on their website when i first started going. otherwise i dont know why i went in the first place. i dont have depression. so it made me eel really shit and really inadequate to go today i felt like i didint belong there and it was embarassing that i would just be going to talk bout how stressed i was about home,and random things that i get anxious about. i dont know. if someone else in the gorup didnt really fit in with the criteria ther i wouldnt mind them being there. bu for some reason, i feel like people wouldnt want me there, and maybe thye wont feel comfy talking bout things cos there was someone there who didnt have depresosn... i did wonder before why it seemed like i was the only one who didtn say i was depressed lol. i only ever said that i had problems with anxiety (during our intros at the beginning of group). cant believe no one ever said anything lolllll. everyone always said at the intro thye had depression, or depression and anxiety, and i said i had anxiety loll. i thought i was doing better last week, i was still down but not as bad as the week before, it was only when i wasnt as sad that i realised how shit my mood was the two weeks before last week. i cant beleive i just coasted through it lol. i should have gone to the doc or soemthing. ah well. but then  ijust realised that i actually wasnt relaly doing better last week. the only reason why i felt calmer last week and bette rable to cope was because i kept thinking to myself i wouldnt have to be alive much longer, that it would all be over soon, i didnt have any plans per se, but when i got pankcy over my dad and fet like i couldnt cope and didnt know what to do, i i just thought that i didnt have to suffer for much longer. that it will all come to an end very very soon. and that calmed me down so muhc! itsp rolly not the best way to calm down, but thats what worked for me. so i guess thats why i felt better. darn thoughti actually did better and then this week . somehow i feel like im going crazy or soemthgn. not all the time. just most of the time. my mood is really shit alot of the time, i saw the counsellor yesterday but somehow i stil lfeel shit. feel like i hsould be coping better because i saw the cousnellor but no. haha . still wishing everyday i could die. prolly bit of a mood killer if u ask me. psych gave me an earlier appt thats still 3 weeks away, makes me feel like they just dont want to see me soon, becaue theyre never busy in that clinic. its always empty. makes me feel like shit and i dont want to ask AGAIN for an earlier apointmetn cos i dont want to be dramatic. even tho i keep thinking about dying everyday.. hm. fun i was going to say something else... darn i forgot. oh yeh working in that ghetto shop again. seriously, that place creeps me out. but im tired of looking for places to volunteer so ill stay here untill i get so scared i dont go in, or untill i find somehwere thats defo better hmm what else... i like doing updates! i really really really wanna go to that support group, i like the people there and im used to it :( blah . ill talk to the counsellor bout it next week. hrm hrm hrm. also i like updating people. i have funny stories sometimes and its cool. it has been pretty quiet recently hough. poeple going through shit and also cos its the summer. hmm. i wish i had more friends. no where atm to look for them tho. college ppl i know arent great :( for one reason or another lol. dont mean that in a mean way. college results came back yeterday. failed 3 exams. havent told thefather yet because i cant cope with telling him. hes so unpredictable. i dont even tlak to him unless i need ot because i get so stressed, and i keep htinking of how he has been. hes so pleasant now its weird and i dont know how to act. lette rfrom college today telling us what to do if we failed. i typed up a diff letter in case my dad wanted to see to cover up. i just odnt feel able to tell him yet that i failed. hes going to say so many things about it :( . he still does the little insults every now and then ( ""people like you...."") . he doenst rly get 'angry' anymore, bt it still gets to me, the insults. why is my own father like that. lol. ok cant think of anything else. if i do ill say it next time adios!@@4
428@@ I've been off work for the last week. Unable to cope. I have been struggling with dealing with some things that my bf had said to me. They hurt...a lot. And at the same time he said he still loved me, still wanted to be with me. Which just made no sense to me. The two didn't go together...he couldn't say all that to me and then still want to be with me. So I tried to trick myself into believing I hadn't understood what he was saying, or that I took it all the wrong way, it all got twisted in my head. Anything. But no. I was right all along. It all became clear yesterday. He posted a thread on some other site I use about it...and I realised I hadn't misunderstood, I hadn't twisted it, hadn't taken it the wrong way. It was exactly what I thought it was. And now he just broke up with me. For the last year he has been the person that has been keeping me safe. Every time things have gone bad and I've ended up suicidal he was there to help me through it, encourage me to get help and go to the hospital. Now what have I got? I'm suicidal...have been for the last week or maybe more. And that lifeline that I had is gone. I just see no reason to continue. Everything is shit.@@3
429@@ I guess I should have taken my brother's advice and done the world a favor and killed myself. After all, according to him, my mother despised me, my father despised me and he despises me. According to my own brother, no one wants me here. I know that, if I were to die today, the only reason anyone would come to my funeral...even have one for me...is to make sure I am dead so that they can celebrate my death...ding dong, the ugly, fat, old, worthless witch is finally dead!@@4
430@@ Everything is going well for me. I've been dating this guy for 6th months now. He's extremely in love with me. I have gotten straight A's all year at school. I have a job as a lifeguard. However; I still feel like killing myself? I still feel alone yet I'm surrounded by everything I could want. I continuously feel like nothing, like there are so many people out there who are better so why even try. I feel like everything I do is so insignificant. Someone please, respond to me.@@4
431@@ I have been depressed for a while and I just realized that I get easily replaced very often. School is a very tough time for me because I have social anxiety and get walked on all the time. I've been bullied for one reason or another because of little quirks I have or certain personal traits that I can't help such as wearing glasses or twirling my hair. People have called me annoying, easy, ugly, naÃ¯ve, dumb and everything under the sun. I am so used to being insulted that I even insult myself sometimes. The recent found fact that I am easily place honestly proves that I am a waste of space. So I have to ask: is it even worth living anymore?@@4
432@@ Posted about an hour or so ago about life-crippling anxiety.  Well, as is routine, its gotten worse in the little time since I posted it.  The only release, the only fucking REMOTE COMFORT, is to visualize overly-descriptive suicide.  To motivate myself to ""fix the problem"" in the way I've always been too cowardly to before.  The fear of failing, and all the negative consequences that can fuck me up so much worse that come with, has kept me this farâ€”but every fucking hour this sickening feeling inside gets worse and fucking worse. If I committed suicide I wouldn't feel nearly as fucking sick to my stomach as I do now. Distractions don't help.  Friends no longer help.  The internet no longer helps.  Telling myself this defeatist attitude is irrational doesn't help.  I'm a snowball building momentum towards the fucking end.@@3
433@@ Well basically I've known this girl  for almost a year now and have been talking to each other every day. At  first I only saw her as a friend but as I got to know her more and the  more we spent time with each other I began developing strong feelings  for her. Now to be fair she was already with someone when we first met  and from what I could tell she was strongly in love with this guy. I  know it is probably my fault for falling in love with a girl who was  already with someone but I couldn't help it. I was really lonely and she  was the only person who ever talked to me every day. I told her about how I really feel about her but she told me that she  will never see me that way because she loves her partner ""way too much"". Nice She told me ""I'm sorry but I'm really really happy with my partner."" It  really hurt me when she said it like that. I put so much into this girl  yet she's in love with someone else. Someone else will get to have her and not me. I always lose like usual. I just don't know how to get over this. life  is just so unfair. They will probably go on to get married and have a  happy life while I'm the loser who will be alone forever and probably  end up killing myself. I just don't know how much longer I can do this@@4
434@@ I've read that people can go to the emergency room if they're feeling particularly suicidal and thinking of hurting themselves. I'm just wondering when you would know it's time to do this. I feel like if you do something to stop yourself from killing yourself (like going to the ER) then they wouldn't really know whether you were really going to hurt yourself or not... And how do you know it's not another time you might call a crisis hotline and feel better or just plain back out? I wouldn't want to put myself in a situation that's unnecessary but I also don't know what is necessary. I also find I can talk about suicide with friends without them believing I'll go through with it. None of my threats have ever been met with any serious response. It's almost frustrating... like I almost want them to see know how it would feel if I go through with it and they could have tried to do something to stop me. I know that sounds horrible... but I don't feel like I know what to do when I get really suicidal and I can't trust anyone to stop me... I feel like deciding not to kill myself shouldn't be a decision left with the girl who wants to kill herself, you know?@@3
435@@ I think iâ€™m just finished. I have no more motivation.. im an alcoholic, I am 28 years old and still live with my parents. I have absolutely no life besides work which i Did not go into today without calling them, so I wouldnt be surprised if ive lost that as well. I have 0 friends and I feel like im stumbling down an endless road that leads to nowhere. There is nothing that makes me happy, nothing i am proud of, and overall I honestly just fucking hate myself. I always feel like I say the wrong thing whenever i speak so I just try to avoid talking to anyone. The healthcare system is bullshit here in the U.S. I should probably be on meds and go see a therapist, but i dont have the money for that and quite frankly i lack any motivation to get up and try. Giving up seems like the easiest option right now. Whats the fucking point??@@5
436@@ Hi all, I am in bad situation and do not see any light at the end of tunnel. I have thoughts of committing suicide but still do not have the guts to do it. I am not in depression. But life is hard and i dont understand why human life is treated so preciously. When i am suffring every day and merely existing and not living - why should not i end my life.@@4
437@@ This is me. This is what is inside. Raw, putrid, stink.  Blood of an unholy color. One that can't be defined. Only to be despised and turned away. My pain is the only thing that reminds that I'm still alive.  Happy is just a mask. Funny is only a shield. Never had beauty or a beautiful body. Something has always been wrong-awkward and unfit.  I don't belong here. I belong with death. No heaven, only hell. But no one will ever know because no one could ever understand or love what is truly me. To even believe that I have any worth to anyone is stupid.  Who dares to love me? I'm only good for being used up and thrown away. There is nothing good of my soul because I've been rejected one. I rather am jealous of the dead. Nothing on their body hurts. No one can touch them, they're away. Gone. Just like I wish I was. How I wish I had the courage to join them. Maybe God wants me to. Maybe this is my purpose.  To be the first of my line to kill themselves.  That would mean that I've accomplished something that I actually did with no ones help.  My children will be fine. They'll soon forget. My family will label me a selfish coward and refuse to utter my name. My friends may cry a little.  Then leave the funeral home (if I have one) and go about their own lives.@@4
438@@ This is my first post here. I am a 36 year old guy battling suicidal depression. I have a good therapist, and I'm trying to work through my personal issues (especially relating to my father, with whom I broke off contact more than two years ago because of his untreated alcoholism and inability to be supportive). I also attend weekly Al-anon meetings. But I honestly struggle with wanting to stay alive. Most of me does. But then I get into these despairing states of mind, and I start thinking of how unhappy I've been and how unhappy I continue to be, and suicide seems to make sense. I don't want my life to end that way. I would like to experience some joy and pleasure in my life before I die. I'm angry because I feel my life has been nothing but pain and hardship and adversity, and I'm so tired of proving time and time again how ""tough"" I can be by ""truckin' through"" and overcoming obstacles. It's exhausting. Anyway, sorry for being so vague, but I figured this is enough for a first post.@@3
439@@ I was going to post this in Venting, but this seems like a better spot. I have Thursday through Sunday off. My first day(s) off in God knows how long. I don't deserve it. I'm almost tempted to come into work on Thursday anyway, even though I'd be useless. I have some ideas on how to spend it, but honestly I'm worried about where my mindset will be. Work causes a lot of anxiety, but time alone flat out makes me feel hopeless. That's often when suicidal feelings start to creep up. No, hanging out with friends isn't an option because I don't have any. My brother lives an hour away, but hell, seeing my family makes me pretty damn hopeless too. I've been thinking more lately about what method I would use, and it's crossed my mind to just try and enjoy this weekend, then be done with it all. Everything sucks.@@4
440@@ I am in my forties.  I've been unhappy with life since I was around 12; I just didn't feel like I fit into this world, had little confidence in myself.  My social life has never been stellar either.  Fast forward to now.  The way I feel about existence hasn't changed, but now I have the added bonus of a chronic illness which leaves me tired all the time.  So I have to face this world that I hate with little energy.  If anything, I have more reason to leave. There is the issue of courage though.  I just don't have it- yet.  But damn I hate being alive.  I hate everyday.@@4
441@@ It has been too long. Forgive me for typos; I'm writing off of my smartphone. I've been like this for over 5 years now. I have seen myself as worthless for that long. Regardless of if I actually deserve such a fate, I've been wasting valuable thought processes on this shot for long enough to make me a stunted, unless individual. I recently broke up with my girlfriend for purely selfish reasons She found out that I had essentially cheated on her four months ago about two days after. I want to die. There is no reason for me to keep going. I offer nothing. I bring nothing to the table. I should have killed myself 4 years ago when I initially planned on it. I am worthless. Anyone on this site who knows who I am knows this. I want to die.@@3
442@@ Let's be honest. I have made too many mistakes. I am too worthless to live. I am reminded of that every single day. I had plenty of opportunities to kill myself before but I never took them. Now things are getting worse with no hope of it getting better. It's no longer a matter of if I kill myself, it's when. It could be today, tomorrow, next week, whenever, but I will do it. I can't go on. I'm sick of being oppressed, of being stupid, of being alive. I will never be good enough. I hate everything about myself. I wish I was dead.@@3
443@@ hi I need to know if it gets better@@5
444@@ I work two jobs, one in the mid-morning to afternoon and one in the evening every so often. I seem to always have the house to myself for at least two hours a day and if I am lucky, the whole weekend if my grandparents are out. The only problem is, whenever I get really down in a day, I think of how easy I could just commit suicide. I know I have no intentions with these thoughts but sometimes I'm not sure. I want them gone. I have things to do but sometimes i just want to drop it all.@@3
445@@ I'm actually resonably content with what I've been able to achieve in my life, I've just reached a point where there isn't much I enjoy anymore. I've had much darker times in my life, but these days my low mood is more persistent. I have more bad days than good and the scale keeps tipping the wrong way. Honestly, the biggest, and maybe only, reason I don't do it is because of my family, even though I'm more distant from them than ever and was never that close with them to begin with. Plus, afterall, it's my life we're talking about, not theirs. There doesn't seem to be much point in continuing to do this.@@4
446@@ Hey everyone. It's my first time writing. I'm 31 and living alone, never had a real girlfriend, just a couple of dates. It tears me up to see all my friends married or with someone and i'm all alone... Sometimes when i fell real lonley i think about suecide. I allmost came real close to doing it once and because i work in a chemical lab it is very easy for me to do it. I'm tring to stay positive but it's just not working. I tried to go to a psychologist but it didn't help me. Every day that passes by is very painfull and sad. i'm so scares of waking up one day at 40 years old and still being single.@@4
447@@ Not a single person. I could die tomorrow and it would affect nobody. This is why I want to commit suicide and will probably be the reason I do it in the future. It hurts too much@@2
448@@ School ended. Summers are HARD for me! I sit and home for one day and I want to die already. I think my life is meaningless and I am so sad. Worst part is that next semester will be my LAST semester before I have to work full time. I'm having some kind of break down. It's always about the same thing. I want my parents to love me. They never said they don't but I feel unloved. I feel like I have to meet their expectations for them to love me. This is unreasonable! They do love me, right? But I feel ... like they don't. No one ever tells me they love me. No one spends close time with me. ALL I've wanted for so many years is love and approval and for someone to tell me I'm okay they way I am. Cognitive therapy has been helpful for me. I need to remember to do it! I have no motivation to do it until I'm in state like this or worse. When I think about the future, I see a future where everything is grey and unhappy. Nothing seems fulfilling. I just want to go to bed and cry. Everything seems hopeless. Fatigue makes me feel hopeless so I know it's best if I go to bed soon. I need to sign up for volunteer work ASAP. I can't stay home anymore. These thoughts fill up my mind. And no one to remind me to challenge them.@@4
449@@ In college I was always a well-rounded person, driven and confident in academics and passionate about my studies. One I hope to either work with low income families to access financial assistance and healthcare. Until near the end of my junior year of college things changed. Before college, I had many interrelated family conflicts, although I was the nephew, son and grandson to them. I experienced second-handed or was influenced by those conflicts from family mistrust, accusation, mother transitioning and coping with the death of my father and grandfather. our family begin to disperse and get seperated. We no longer spend holidays as a whole or socialize or try to solve past issues. I stayed strong until I was falsely judged as being something I'm not in my college campus. I occured more than once. After all those events I became angered on the day after i took the exam in the auditorium. I began to scream, swear in my own head and imagination. it gotten worse, I have anxiety and breathe hard after slowing become angry and pay attention to those accusations about me. I wonder sometimes and I ask myself questions about why they accused me. I never verbally judged anybody in life... Worse, I been carry thoughts and imagine people and absorb negativity and hallucinate in my mind with swears.., and more. On top of that, I appear to be able to send psychic message through with both intentional and unintentional thoughts. People can hear me... I been dealing with this since 2013 at work, in school, at home and during social events. It's like ever since I internalize all those thoughts I became a whole different person inside. People can hear me... I can  see their reaction? I am not psychotic.. I know I have such abilities... WHy people have to hear my imaginations... This Is how i begun to have suicidal thoughts... Dealing with negative pasts, being insecured and paranoid in the whole mix of send psychic message at the same time!? I did not wanted this...@@3
450@@ So I've had depression for a long time, over 10 years. I have wanted to commit suicide as young as 11 years old and now I'm 23. I've tried it a time or two with little success. At one point I sold all the harmful objects I owned so I wouldn't use one but then a couple months ago I bought a new one. Secretly the reason I bought it is because it makes me feel anxious to not have an acceptable way out within reach. I don't know if my depression comes from a chemical imbalance or my shitty life. Ironically my shitty life is the result of living with depression and suicide fantasies for so damn long. When I was a teenager and didn't know any better I tried to commit suicide. Of course this didn't work, it did mess me up for a bit though. I am a quiet person most of the time, I have the personality of a plank of wood and on top of that I am fat and unattractive. I have been single for about 6 years and that last relationship I'm not even sure was real, I'm not sure the girl was real. She always told me stories about how she was abused by her step-dad and one day we finally decided to meet up(it had been purely text based up to that point, pathetic I know) So she tells me where she lives and I go there, she tells me the road and what the house looks like exactly, I go and knock on the door and the person that answered the door didn't know who I was or the girl I was looking for. Then I found out that the pics she sent me of herself were actually of some other girl that my ""best friend"" at the time was dating. I never heard from her again after that, I tried to find her and her friend but they seem to not exist on the internet. Just recently I tried dating again for the first time in years and it didn't go well. Both girls I went out with on one date each and they both weren't interested. One seemed interested when we were just texting then as soon as I pick her up she turns into a different person and is no longer interested in me. I hate my hobbies, I hate my job that pays so low I can't afford to move out of my moms house. I hate how the only way I can behave even close to normal in a social situation is if I'm drunk or high on pills. I hate how over the years I've used food to make myself feel better which has made me fatter and uglier than I ever was. I hate how when I'm with people I can't think of anything to say or talk about. Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my eye sight because everything is blurry then sometimes I can see perfectly clear, is that all in my head. I hate how everyone I meet is in a relationship, they have kids a nice car and a place of their own. I hate how I haven't had sex in years. I have one friend left and I get the suspicious feeling he makes fun of me behind my back, I can feel the pity radiate from him. I know my family thinks they care about me but I think they just do it because they are supposed to since were family. When they see I am depressed they either ignore it or just say cheer up. My mom has a close relationship with my sisters, they talk about everything yet she has never in my entire life made an attempt to talk to me about how I feel about anything. I feel like an outsider amongst my own family and I feel like an alien amongst everyone else. I just want to kill myself and end it all, sure they would be sad for a short time but I think that would be more shock then genuinely missing me. I've been fantasizing about killing myself one way, but I'm not sure that's how I want to go, other times I fantasize about other ways. Then there is another method I've read about that I won't share but it seems like a good way to go, very peaceful and even painless. I know the other ways I imagine wouldn't be painless but what's a short time of pain compared to a life time. I'm worthless and I realize that. I've never sought professional help before, I assume it's expensive and therapists are for the middle and upper class. Sometimes my mind just sort of shuts off and I don't think I just feel emotion and pain because there are more causes and effects than I can count, it's like they just add up and add up and the effect multiplies. I don't know what to do anymore.@@4
451@@ I think that I may be having a combination of an emotional breakdown mixed with an overwhelming rage and a philosophical drifting but I feel like I could go, whether by personal methods or natural ones as my health has deteriorated with all the things that have happened, and I would not have a quarrel about it. I mean after its all said and done, what's there left at the end of this? I don't lead and don't want a regular life. I find that alot of things aren't at par with what I think or feel. Many of them seem and have been lies told in order to keep me in check. And for all the work I've done, I've seen nothing. No expected results, in fact things keep getting worse with time. I can't have 1 good thing happen without 5 bad ones following it almost immediately. And right now, I don't seem to care one way or the other. Have I reached my limit?@@3
452@@ I have suicidal thoughts on a regular basis, I don't really know the root cause. I just feel I don't want to live anymore, I have lost motivation for life and everyday I'm here is just so long and difficult to get through that I don't see the point anymore. There have been a number of suicides with young people my age in my area recently and I have always thought about their families and what they must be going through. How do I get past these feelings because I couldn't ever do that to my family. Whatever feelings come over me I know that they wouldn't materialise due to this unless the feelings got worse. Please, I'd like some advice on what to do.@@4
453@@ Hey guys I have been really depressed like a lot more then usual and this all starts after middle school I was like the funny fat kid had a lot of friends talked to a lot of people but this changed after I went to highschool I lost a lot of good friends because they all changed and wanted to be the cool kids so I just hung out with normal friends. So  when I was a freshman I really liked a girl she had a class with me and she was really cute but I had a lot of competition because a lot of guys in class tried to talk to to her but after 2 months of joking around and talking to her one day she just told me in a mean tone I was a weirdo I was heartbroken but I hid it I just looked at her and walked away and ever since then I felt even less social because I was scared to be told I was a freak or fat weirdo and it may not seem like it will hurt me but I was able to hide a lot of my depression a lot of people always asked me why do you have white hairs is it because youâ€™re depressed and like always I would lie and say its because im Asian a lot of Asians have white hair but inside I would cringe kinda because I knew it was a lie. After freshman year I came back to school after summer I lost a lot more friends a lot had their own crowd so I hung out with my Mexican friends they were mean but over time they stopped being deuchebags and matured I started talking a little more to new people because of my new classes but after that year I went to a continuation school because I was behind credits. When I was at the new school I met a lot of old friends I havenâ€™t talked to in a long long time and it felt good south brought me to meet my old friends in middle school and it felt good to be social but ive been depressed about a lot of stuff before middle school I remember I used to get beat by my older brother a lot and it was for stupid reasons to and everytime I got beat my mom wouldnâ€™t do anything she just watched as I got beat up on the ground this went on til junior year begun this was why I was depressed a lot to in highschool because my mom never loved me she only cared about my sisters and brotherâ€™s happiness I remember she bought them a lot of cloths and things I always wanted that kind of care and love but she ignored me a lot I remember once when I was a freshman I was sick and my mom was going somewhere so I wanted to leave because my brother would beat me for staying home and he was already 18 I was like 14-15 cant remember to much beatings but when I tried to leave he made me stay and then he beat me senseless in front of my mom and she just stood and watched he punched me so hard the top of my eyebrow started to bleed a lot and after that my mom just cleaned the top of my brow and said do good in life and I really wanted to call the cops this time but she said no and left to where ever she went to and I just cried on the couch and went to sleep btw I slept on the living room floor because I couldnâ€™t share a room with my sisters they are girls and I wouldnâ€™t sleep in the room with my brother because he would throw his shoes at me if I snored a bit my  mom never cared to buy me a cruton so I slept on the floor all the time my cloths was in the hallway how fake he was when his friends came over he acted so nice to everyone but in heart he was a demon and I still fear him sometimes. Once I came home and was playing the computer my mom told me to get off and do homework but I had no homework so I told her that and all she said was wait til your brother gets home when he got home he told me to get off so I got off then he told me to delete my game I told him no he punched me and told me to delete it I said no again he punched me this time I got up and I tried to fight him I know I was gonna win but my mom came and stopped me and then held me down as my brother punched my face for 2 mins straight after that beating I just cried myself to sleep ever since then I wanted to kill myself his beatings  made me depressed my mom holding me down letting my brother beat me up just because he was simply older and she said its wrong to hit your older sibling but I was thinking then what makes him able to beat me all the time ever since then I hated everything about my life I still do I plan on taking my own life after I turn 18 or sometime after I graduate which will be 1 year from now summer just started gonna be a senior soon I want to die because all the depression I had as a kid to an adult I stopped trying in school after 10th grade because I have no love from anyone I suffer anti-socialism a lot I makes me kinda sad when my friends just walk past me like we never met and its not like im going anywhere in life just taking up room in America wasting my time being alive but soon I will die I want my family to suffer when I die because all the suffering and depression ive been through I know I can be stronger but I just want to give up because I just donâ€™t care anymore  btw sorry if I sound really selfish im crying as I write this because they will eventually look and find this they probably wont care but yeah im hoping to die soon might kill myself when they find me I will leave a note and I hope they find this so everyone will know the suffering ive been through and my dad tried to kill my whole family when i was 5 mom divorced him when we escaped found a new stepdad he hates my whole family@@3
454@@ I feel like self harming again. I feel like quitting everything, I don't want to live like this anymore.@@5
455@@ My neighbor who is also my friend, called me when she found out I had been having suicidal thoughts and said ""You don't have the guts to .....(specific form of suicide there)!""  Then she asked if I wanted her to come downstairs and do it for me because it was something she had done to herself before.  Her and I had already had conversations about this a while ago and she knew it was triggering to me to say that.  She was also mad that I didn't tell her how I had been feeling for 2 weeks, but this was the exact reason I didn't tell her, I knew I couldn't handle her talking again about what she had done to herself and how none of my past attempts had been real.  This was about a week ago when this conversation took place and I haven't talked to her since.  The next time I hear from her will most likely be when she wants/needs a ride or something.  I find it almost impossible to tell people I'm mad at them but even if I told her she won't get it.  She is an active alcoholic and hard to reason with even when she is sober.  But she is my only local friend and now I'm scared of her and the whole thing is not helping my depression at all.  I can't avoid her forever but I'm still in the process of dealing with my suidical ideations.  What do I do?@@4
456@@ Not really sure why. But I'm starting to form some kind of plan in my head. It's not very detailed at the moment...but I fear that it will become so. Except fear is the wrong word. Because I'm kind of welcoming this change. I knew it was only a matter of time until my head would go back down this line of thinking. And now it has I'm kind of relieved as it means I have a reason to follow through with it. Suicide is never far from my mind even when I am feeling ok. I just need to feel bad to push me to it. And that's kind of what I want. I'm not sure if this is making much sense...it's barely making sense to me.@@3
457@@ Feeling so down, self harm not helping and its so hard to not go further. I dont know if this has been said before, but all i ever hear is how bad suicide is on family and friends, do THEY not realise that it is not something done lightly? that people just cant take anymore? why is it they get all the sympathy and the right to be angry? Shouldnt THEY be more understanding if a family member or friend commits suicide?@@4
458@@ So I've kind of accepted that I am alone in the way I think and live my life. I do have family that care about me and I'd hate to hurt them but at the same time I know I am a disappointment and a failure to them and their connection to me is from genetics rather than choice. I haven't really gotten to the point of attempting anything yet. I may never, except I do know once I make up my mind there is no stopping me. My life is a huge mess, I can't maintain a romantic relationship  (even if my life depended on it, LOL!), and I owe a large sum of money to one of the people I care most about in this world. Honestly there are only 3 people whose continued existence anchors me here because I don't want to disappoint them (more than I already have with my life). Without them I'm pretty sure I'd slip away. Thanks for letting me get that out, I can't really tell anyone else other than the sarcastic remark when things aren't going well (and recently they haven't at all). My question to all of you is have you thought about trying to tie up your affairs, such as sell what you hold dear and perhaps live close to poverty in order to set straight financial obligations? If I'm going to leave this world (or even if not) I want to have a clean slate, not owing anyone and not leaving them harmed by my existence. Maybe I can even do some good on the way out so to speak. I don't really want to die so much as get out from under the pressing weight of life's obligations. On the one hand I really try to make people happy and many of them use me and then betray me when my usefulness ends. On the other hand I haven't been able to improve the lives of my family at all as I would like to. So maybe trying to tie things together and live more simply can change my outlook. Does anyone have experience with thinking about or doing this?@@5
459@@ I can only think of drugs, and being alive for another year just to get high doesn't seem worth it.@@3
460@@ My head has been a mess the last few days. My bf said something which I think I must have taken the wrong way but it's been enough to make me think these dark thoughts. I am staying with him for this week and honestly I wish I could go home. I am majorly tempted to harm myself, make this end. He has something I could use just sitting on his desk and it's taking a lot of willpower to stop myself. Everytime I am in the room alone I find myself staring at it. I think I can keep myself safe while I'm here, but if these thoughts stay when I go back home I don't know what will happen. I have the means there too. I just can't do life anymore. So sick of it. I trust nothing. I'm expecting the worst always. Can't believe anything positive.@@4
461@@ Every single day has become a struggle. Multiple thoughts a day to the point where I am now just fantasizing about not 'being'. I had one near attempted episode about 10 months ago. I don't know how I managed to pull through/pull out last minute, still had some strength left in me I guess. When I was 18 and and at 22 I attempted as well. I am in my mid-30's now... not willing to give up yet, but what scares me is that each day I become more OK with the thought of it. I am still holding on to the thought that I cannot leave my poor mother alone. (It is pretty much just us left in the fam.) I can't bear to think of putting her through the pain. There was a huge thunder and lighting storm the other day and I just laid there in bed, hoping the giant oak that is dangerously close and hanging above our tiny cabin would come crashing down and take me with it. I have alienated myself from everyone, including my mother. Queen of self-destruction.@@4
462@@ This morning I was diagnosed with throat cancer. They will operate next week to see if they can save me or not. I don't want my (10 year old) daughter to see me detiorate in front of her eyes. I've seen chemotherapy. I think I should write a long letter and take a short walk...@@5
463@@ (NOTE:  I am not encouraging anything with this post, everybody has their own rationale regarding it and I'm not trying to change anybody's mind.  But I am mentioning suicide and my feelings personal feelings regarding it that I've had to get off my chest for a long time now.) Some people don't really understand the pain that I go through.  Or maybe they understand the pain through second-hand empathy or through infrequent episodes that they don't have to fear could return at any moment. The only thing keeping me from death is cowardice and knowing it is too easy to fail and wind up with an even worse life than the shit hand I'm already dealt.  If there was a failsafe way, I'd have been dead a long time ago. But every time somebody tells me not to, my resentment increases.  All they are really doing is showing me the futility of life.  ""The best reasons we can give you to live are..."" and then they spew off the same contrived shit that's never meant a fucking thing to me.  Fuck meaningless platitudes.@@3
464@@ Step 1. Something gives me temporary euphoric sense of hope Step 2. Something brings doubt to that sense of hope or I come to find out it was treacherous all along Step 3.  I wallow in fucking despair Step 1.  Something gives me another sense of hope.  Rinse and fucking repeat. Every single time the hope gets smaller and smaller as I become more and more callous to it.  Yet every fucking time the hopeless that comes afterward gets stronger and fucking stronger. The advice is always the fucking same.  Platitudes and empty sentiments meant to stroke somebody's own ego. No hotline, website, drug, or otherwise has what I need.  Human interaction, at least for me, is a joke.  I'm a disposable piece of trash for people in need who can throw me away once they're not longer in need.@@4
465@@ Hello hello So yesterday was the last session with the counsellor at the suicide prevention centre, by no means was I ready to leave (in a way i actually got worse), but they had a limited amount of sessions for each client because  they are always in high demand. She got me a card before i left, and she said she only got them for the special ones haha. anyways, i didnt read what she wrote till i left, partly because i was crying thoughout the whole session and i couldnt really see anyway, and also i didn't want another reason to start crying again, because i was very very emotional. When i got back to the car i read the card and i forgot the exact wording but the last bit was her saying that she wished that i could believe i mattered. Because in a lot of the sessions especially the ones near the end, i said that i felt like my feelings didnt matter, and just because i couldn't cope it didn't really matter because when i tried reaching out to my mother, it never really worked out. and at the end she would always just leave me, or tell me to go away , or that there was nothing she could say so it was up to me to manage on my own, or that there's no point in listening to me if i don't listen to her. And my father isnt really one to go to, so i always felt like what i felt or thought didn't really matter, because i just couldn't let things go, or i wouldn't stop crying and it frustrated my mother too much so she couldn't handle it. I actually forgot what i wanted to say haha. i Hate losing track of my mind. but anyways. ill just make up an new msg. Just wanted to share this with ye's, i feel like what my cousnellor said would benefit alot of ppl (imo), and it made me feel a bit better today when i was crying in my room. Some tear drops got on the card too. Darn. I can't believe she got me a card! YAY! . She did say that i could always come back if i was struggling again, and that alot of the same people keep coming back cos they weret coping. So she said to give it a few weeks and if i feel like im still not managing then go back and give them a call. which is nice. so ill have somewhere to go back to if im really not managing better. got in touch with a differen counselling centre that is more ongoing, missed a call from them yesterday and today when i called back the receptionist was very unhelpful when i said i was returning call from ____. He said she wasn't here and told me to call back again tomorrow. Would usually have thought the general procedure is to take a message from the caller and leave it for the person the next time they come in. So that pissed me off. Sometimes i think if people can't do a job properly they shouldn't be working there. But there ye have it. I'm going to learn off what i want t osay in the gorup tomorrow. because ive been getting worse when its my turn to talk and im getting too anxious, and i completely froze last week and couldnt think at all. so hopefully learning off little passages will help. or give me a starter or something I actually just wanted to share what my counsellor said . and it turned into a rant. sorry ...got upset after a while haha. Also my is a bit chaotic atm. so thats fun Still feel like im going crazy some times because my emotions are too intense and all over the place Anyways thats all for now. just wanted to drop back in and update yes Bye@@3
466@@ I've been too depressed for too long and all my attempts at treatment have failed. It's become increasingly apparent that no one would care if I was dead. My best friends who I care about more than anything won't acknowledge that I exist. They all won't talk to me if I don't talk to them and, even then, half the time they won't reply. Yet they expect me to believe they'd miss me if I was dead. I know I'm worthless and I can't change that. I could never be happy with who I am because I'm stuck as this thing that's lesser than everyone I know. I can't make an impression on anyone, I'm not particularly talented or smart and I'm ugly. I don't want to be this person anymore. I'm just too afraid to go through with killing myself. I've just been wishing that something out of my control would kill me soon...@@4
467@@ I owe something to myself Just one thing to keep me separate from the madness that attempts to consume me I know not how people should live their lives or how they should go about their existence But I am sure of one thing I owe myself one good death Much like without life there is no death There is no life without death Imagine having everything you could ever want Money, fame, power, respect What would you do with it I have spent much of my time pondering that possibility And I have come to the conclusion that I would not do anything I have no ambition to do anything if I have everything What then is the point of moving towards anything new What newer feelings will I experience when I have experienced everything No one has ever really cared for me I have this understood for a long time Humans always place the interests of themselves over the interests of others It is not a fault of character, but of biology Our society reflects this Feuding groups agree to non-violence in the interest of preserving their existence This fact has led me not to depression but to a lack of purpose This is why I have confronted this question of death And why I believe I owe it to myself to die The only reason I am still with you is because I believe I am in love I am in love with a girl I barely know She has beautiful blonde hair and the prettiest smile Something about her I can just tell These feelings probably sound ridiculous and I don't have any ability to explain them They fly in the face of my entire worldview of rationalism and self-preservation Most of my friends find me insane, but somehow I just know She does not love me back It is complicated Her position is clear, easily understandable, and frankly she makes good points She has her reasons and I respect them I am not the best for her She can do better; she knows it; and I know it In a while, we will separate for a long time Possibly, forever Shall I pursue her or shall I accept my fate and reach for the death that I have owed myself for a long time I don't know With regret, atieclxx@@5
468@@ First of all, i want to say that i am sorry for not being on this site for week or so. I attempted suicide and self harmed and one person made me save myself via Skype. I was so determined to do it, i even wrote good bye messages and letters, which i deleted before i went to hospital and hid letters... i would have died in few hours if she didnt talk me out of it... I went to hospital and said to them what i did and they helped me and held me there for few days. Then i asked them to give me psychiatrist and then he prescribed me some pills, upon my request to take medications. It happened what i thought would happen, i stopped feeling... Completelly... I feel numb and detached... Whole world seems to pass me by.... I feel sleepy all the time, i dont have motivation to do anything, i feel like i died... Thats one of the reasons why i didnt log in here after i was released... I literally cant feel, happiness, sadness, pain... anything... I feel useless.... I feel that i am not the person i was i feel like i died.. I am thinking of stopping medication, but that would again leave me vulnerable for me to be triggered by stuff and would possibly result in another attempt(s) of suicide and would probably kill me... But this what i am feeling for past few days since i am on medication is same as death... I see happy stuff, i dont feel happy, i see sad stuff i dont feel sad... My bestie sent me message that she wanted to kill herself, due to some problems with her boyfriend... i didnt feel anything... I would normally feel worried, scared, panic, sad and all mixture of emotions.... but this time i didnt feel anything, my mind reacted in ""whatever"" way. I talked her out of it and calmed her down, but non of my words were expression how i felt, because i couldnt feel.... I dont know what to do.... I dont know why to live... I dont know what do i get from still being alive... I am really better of dead.... :/ Imagine a world without people. Wouldnt it be such a nice place. Natural. For at least 15 years or so now I have been toying with or fantasising about suicide. Many different methods pondered. Many different senarios that could be allowed to carry through resulting in my final goal. And yet, for the sake of my family I have always held back. My dad is now nearing 80. If I had of got on with it a few years ago he would probably have been able to handle it better than now that he is becoming a frail old man. I am sure it would affect his health. As for my mother, it would give her something to tell everyone in her constant quest for attention and sympathy. But I think she would still continue her life reasonably well. You see, she had an unhappy childhood and it has beaten into her a certain psychopathic quality. I have gained it to. For certain reasons I dont really want to disclose, I hate my parents so much. It is a health reason which they have always ignored, telling me I cant know, Im too young, too stupid, too crazy. On the other hand, they are my only real family. And I naturally love them. From a distance. I moved abroad because I was starting to get a little worried about being able to reach them so easily. (I should point out that the moving abroad bit is to make sure it never happens.OK?) I am now older. 27 to be exact. I was raised with good morales. I know right from wrong. All these thoughts, plans, constant rantings. And the only people I ever put myself through all this torture for, are to me as good as dead. They constantly put me down. I feel like I should be put down. Whats stopping it from happening? The constant struggle of life. Get on with life. This wonderful shitty gift. Youre soo lucky. LOOK! Isnt the world a beautiful place? Yeah it is. But there is too many stupid fucking people.@@4
469@@ Not much after my last post here I came dangerously close to...something extreme but a friend made me promise not to after she discovered what I was gonna do.  She made me fucking promise not to do it again...but she's part of the fucking reason i WANT to... I almost did it again.  I have no one to talk to.  No one to cope with what she's done to me, or what I've done to myself.  More importantly, I have no future.  Just meat waiting to expire.  She was just the final nail in the coffin. Fuck me.  Fuck this.  Is it okay to take back a promise if the person made you promise shit AFTER SHITTING ALL OVER YOU?  I dont know why I fucked agreed. I am more hopeless than I've ever been in my life.  Platitudes and hotlines will NOT help me right now.@@3
470@@ I don't feel safe in this world and with good reason. This planet terrifies me. It's a mystery to me how people can not be nervous living in this world. I feel like I just don't belong here, but I haven't got the courage to kill myself. I'm scared of living and scared of dying. What sort of nightmare is this? It's like a horror film. I can't believe I've had life inflicted on me. It's so cruel. The fear is unbearable. I feel like I belong in the spiritual plane. I'm just not suited to the physical world. I struggle with everyday life. It's like I'm drowning in quick sand and the more I struggle, the further I sink. I can't let myself sink though, as I will just lie there and things will get worse. I don't know what the answer is. I just hope some time I can be at peace. I desperately want my suffering to stop. When I go out, the people around me are like aliens. They're at a different stage in their life. They caught up in the physical world, which is mostly about power and ego trips and profit. They place so much importance on these things and I hate being dragged into it. It's like I'm going a different way to everyone else.@@4
471@@ I am 40 years old. I have been married 21 years. My husband is an alcoholic. I want to leave but I can't.  I don't want to fail at my marriage. I am scared to leave, why? I am depressed always. I try to hide it from my kids but they see it because I am also so angry all the. Why cant i control my life. Why am I so week. I tell my kids to be strong you are in control of your life, you can make it what ever you want to. I am hypocrite. I sm so weak. I know every word he is going to say, every push, spit, or bite. I push back, I say the words back to him. I cry and cry. I want out. I am nobody, I have this over whelming feeling to end it. I know the only way I can ever be free is to die. I said those words to death do us part. He will make me stick to them. I have been do weak and have not been able to it. My will is getting stronger. How can I do it and not destroy my childrens view of me. I need to be free. I don't want to worry all the time. Something is wrong with me. I am nobody. I am old. I am fat. I am a failure. I am crazy. I can not control my life. I have a need to be free. I will never be free until death do us part.@@3
472@@ Despite having kids, a good job and friends, I can't fight the feeling of ending it all. I just want the pain to stop. I can't cope with it any more.@@4
473@@ It's been a while since I've been on TTL, lots of things keep happening and I've been so distracted that I hadn't even thought to. I don't like things constantly happening, I've been wanting to commit suicide or at least self harm and work my way up to suicide but there's just always something happening, everyone around me is always going through things and I can't bring myself to even self harm because of the fear that they'd see and feel even worse. My pain started seeming like it was getting better for a few months and then got back to the way it used to be, now the crippling muscle spasms are back and they're severe enough that they're messing up my joints and which is preventing me from exercising, which is my most effective way of handling my depression. It's making it difficult to do simple things, like walk and pick up objects over 20 pounds. I can't swim anymore, which was another way I delt with feeling miserable (swimming relaxes me), because the water shocks my nerves and my muscles lock up and I almost drown. This has happened in the past but for a while the sensitivity of my back went down so I was able to get in the water, now I can't even get in warm water. So physically I'm not doing very well. I'm not doing well emotionally either. A lot of things are going on, too much for one post, so here's one. Me and my girlfriend were having relationship problems largely due to my depression and lack of communication and lack of trust on her part, so she decided it would be best if we took a break: still together, but just taking some time apart. It was made very clear that we were still together. I was very against this, but she was having a lot of emotional problems that she needed to figure out and I wasn't going to prevent her from trying to work things out on her own even though I thought we could work through them together. So we go on a break for a month and it was terrible. I could feel us growing apart the whole damn time and I tried to end the break but she wouldn't. Well one day she comes over and she says it's best if we break up, even though neither of us wanted that. We did, and then I asked her if she had cheated on me with one of my closest friends, because I could tell just by the way they looked that she had, and she said yes. I don't have very many friends, and I have never been cheated on before, so this was just horrible to hear. The problem was I fucking knew ALL of what was going to happen the second she wanted a break, and I just sat there and let it happen :( so for a while we were broken up, but we both wanted to get back together so we finally did. I love her more than any fucking thing, and now it hurts me to look at her :( we got back together about a month ago and we've only had sex drunk. I don't even know if she's physically attracted to me anymore. I know she loves me, and I love her, but it fucking hurts. And the whole time we were on the break I was hurting physically and emotionally and I made this known and she still didn't come back, which honestly hurts me as much as her cheating (I really hate the term cheating here especially, because before the break we were both looking to expand our sex life and we had agreed that we were going to include this person and that I was going to have sex with him alone because I had never done that with a man, and we were both okay with it, but when the break started we explicitly said we weren't going to fuck anyone). We're in the process of working through this because we both love each other, like I've never felt this way about another person before, but I'm still very hurt over this and can't help but resent her. And of course she's very sad about this whole thing, but I guess the break was actually good for her because she finally talked to her doctor about her depression and is now on medication which I think is helping, and she's not suicidal anymore. But she is still struggling with depression, and after all this shit it still hurts me more than anything to know she's depressed, to see her sad and inconsolable like that. Now about my friend. He has schizophrenic bipolar disorder or something that sounds similar to that. He just turned 18 and is living at my house (I live with my parents because the house is close to the college I go to) because he was living with his insane grandmother at the time who was abusive and kept getting him to do illegal things. He has a baby on the way, but he has a criminal record and didn't finish highschool because of all the legal problems he had. He's extremely depressed about his situation and he told me he wouldve killed himself if he didn't have to worry about his baby growing up without a dad like he did. He feels like he is now just a statistic and that there's no way out of his current situation, but he's extremely intelligent and@@4
474@@ Things are good. I am drug and alcohol free and making plans for the future. I don't feel 'depressed' right now, which is a really good thing. I have a sense of purpose. BUT I consider suicide on a daily basis. Spontaneously. Rapidly. It is hard to not feel overwhelmed by these sudden urges. There are methods all around me every single day and it physically pains me to keep myself in check. I use to get similar feelings when I was younger but they were not self harm but outward harm where I would drift off into daydreams and see myself harming entire rooms full of people. It became so bad that a few times I actually thought I had gone through with it. There was literally no line between reality and fantasy. These episodes would usually be followed by shear panic and utmost distress. Sometimes I would pass out. What I feel now is almost exactly the same but I see myself committing suicide. It isn't as graphically detailed, or as distressing, nor have I passed out. I am fearful of what will happen if I open up to a counsellor, or mental health worker. Is this insanity? I feel even further isolated because I have never heard anyone expressing these kinds of thoughts/feelings. Does anyone else experience this? Can anyone offer advice? Thank you in advance.@@5
475@@ I wanna just do it@@5
476@@ I do not want to live this life any more. I will not live with this disorder. This life is not for me. I really wish I would have never been born with the horrible genetics that I have. I am not the person I know and have not been for years. It is just getting worse and I am considering this again.@@3
477@@ I'm older than probably most on this forum (or so I think) -- mid 50s.  I've had depression since I was a kid.  Sometimes better, sometimes worse, but it's always been there.  I also was anxious around people and never did feel like I fit in, even though other kids liked me and I was popular in school.  I felt like an outcast, and even graduated early from high school to get away from people. It wasn't until after I graduated from college and was working that I finally decided that something wasn't right and sought treatment (talked to a psychiatrist and was given medication for depression and anxiety).  It was the first time I articulated to a professional how alone I felt, even when I had people around me in my life.  The depression medication didn't work, although the anxiety drugs helped with the panic attacks I was having.   At the same time, I had a very poor self image and very low self esteem.  Despite my mental health problems, I was working professionally at a very high level and having considerable success.  But to deal with all the negative emotions/feelings and the stress of work, I developed an addiction, which has plagued me for 30+ years.  Without getting into too much additional detail, I was able to hold everything together for a long time (career, family, etc.) until the addiction finally caught up to me four years ago, and I was fired from my job.  Since then my whole life has collapsed.  My wife left me.  I haven't been able to find a new job.  My friends have left me, except one.  I have tried very hard to get sober, but the depression and anxiety I'm experiencing have gotten in the way.  I think my drug of choice is how I try to help the depression.  [At the same time, I know that continuing the addiction makes the depression and anxiety worse.]  Now I feel so very alone.  It's not just the fact that I only have a few people in my life (mostly just other people at my 12-step support group).  But it's that, just as when I was a kid, I don't feel connected to people even when they are around.  I don't trust them.  More broadly, I don't feel connected to, or can relate to, the outside world.  It all seems so foreign and frightening to me, maybe because of the long-term addiction.  I just don't like this world, and don't see a good reason to continue in it.  My outlook on everything is so so negative.  I know that a few people would be very sad if I killed myself, including my two daughters.  But I have felt so miserable for so long that I can't remember the last time I was truly happy.  And I don't see it ever improving, just continuing to get worse.  I would have killed myself before, but I've been afraid to do it in the past.  I wish God would end my misery, so that I can free of this pain.@@4
478@@ i closed my window by accident :( darn i had such a good post written... i was just going to write down my reason why i think dying would be a good idea. that doesnt mean i want to, its just, i think its good ot keep my options open. and i mean that in the most realistic way. i know myself, and i know my own coping abilities, and i know the lack of resources i hvae, and i know how i am. so just hear me out. Also being insomniac isnt very fun, i want to all the time but instead im just like Sometimes I dont know if im being dramatic or not. my counsellor says that my mother isnt validating my feelings. but maybe she is, and im just too difficult? I don't know, but when im upset these days, she doesnt even come in to ask how im doing, even if i am upset. i think the odd occasiion she 'might' but most of the time its like even though she knows im upset, ie like i tell her and she knows she doesnt say anything bout it afterwards, she doesnt ask me how i am. if my father says something hurtful to me, she wont ask me about it, and i think tis because she said before that it wasn't tha big of adeal, but to me it was. and i guess she did listen when i went to her anyway and told her i was upset. but osmetimes, its nice when u dont have to be the one reporting all the time. its like she juts doesnt register how upset i am, even if i tell her that im really realy upset and i tell her how i get so scared and worried at my dad. i dont know, im so confused. just strikes me as odd, because when ii ask her if she knows im upset, she usually says yes, but she doesnt approach me or anything. i dont get it sometiems she says that im always upset anyways, so maybe she doesnt feel like hteres muc hshe can do . i dont know . hse just never asks me how im doing, rarely asks whats wrong, and i feel so alone. it upsets me alot when shes in the next room and just googling and im here being really upset and she knows i get upset its just i would have thought after telling her so often for so long, she'd catch on and know . and i dont know... just htought it would have been a mother's instinct to comfort their child....not jusut turn away :( i dont know... maybe  watch too much tv. suspicoius bout the cousnellor, she doenst seem to want ot talk to my mother, and i feel like she didnt like it when i was wondering if she could talk to my friend so he could better support me. i thougth she owuld have been happy to do something that would help me... prolly not :/ idk ill ask her next time i see her. she said me wanting to die was very serious , and i understand her logic, but for some reason, i dont feel like its that serious. no idea why. hm. maybe i got used to it. or maybe because she says my parents dont 'validate' how i feel, i feel like its not a big deal? oh i dont know. i dont know. tbh my fathers only gotten really difficult in the last ten years, i feel a bit silly that ive gotten this bad, and my way of thinking. hell i didnt even know it was that bad till a few years back. when things get cemented in your head, u just believe it ye know? and its not weird or abnormal unless someoen says it to u and u finally (partially) realise it yourself, it takes ages to undo a habit that has been learned. oh hey maybe im just being dramatic. idk. i suppoes i am. i wasnt going to go to my support group on thursday becaue last week my hand started shaking when it was my turn to talk and the eejit that i am told everyone my hand was shaking because i was anxious... i mean come on. ye dont need to draw unneccesary attention to ursel.f so yeh everyone kne .bleh. so embarassing. apart from that it seemed okay. but then i was thinking im not really coping at all and im the type who lieks to talk. even if my hand is fucking shaking and i get rly bad anxiety talking in groups (bit counter productive that one), i think istill feel better than if i was all alone with my own thoughts. hm. beause they are very overwhelming. hm . yeh :| gah. eeck so yeh on the bus back home today i was like the whole way through. more or less passed out. im pretty sure i dont sleep that well at home even. ther ye have it.. i forgot what i was going to say. ill end here. soryr, this post probably doent make sense. that song ' my head is a jungle, jungle ...' comes ot mind okay bye!@@3
479@@ 1) mood/emotions keep alternating, and of course my thoughts alternate with them. so yeh, it can get really extreme, and it probably doesnt help that im naturally very emotionally sensitive too. for some reason its been worse lately, and its so overwhelming. i end up kind of drowning in them alot, and thers no one to pull me 2) so alone in all of this, my mother doesnt understand and my father is the one being abusive, and even tho hes mellowed out alot in the last 3 weeks, no idea why, im dealing with the aftermath of him and also getting really stressed that i have to live with him. 3) for some reason my moods have been worse lately, more extreme, and lasting longer, and it kind of sucks, its probably gotten worse becaue ive had to move home after college was over, and i cant afford to move out during the summer. so yep. ha. environment induced rapid bipolar id say ( i joke) but u get my point. just changing all hte itme. i dont always know why i feel shit, it just happens. so ill just suddenly realisee it halfway throught drowning in my emotions, because its so overwhelming 4) no one to turn to when my emotions are overwhelming me, no one to ask for advice and stuff. my mother doesnt udnerstand and she gets upset when i start getting angry/upset (even tho its not like the way my father is, but there ye have it) i'm not always able to identify when im in the middle of some kind of emotional rollercoaster and it helps when someone is there to point things out .... and its more like i just have to sit/wait it out and hope that i dont end up drowning in my emotions and that, somehow, ill be okay at the end of it. its really exhausting with all these emotions and im on my own and it makes it all the worse. its getting really overwhelming and .. oh idk 5) ive tried communicating with my mother as best i could, and unfortunately i have my fathers temperment , not as bad, but still, and we cant communicate and ive tried and tried and ive told her im relaly struggling and i need to her to stay with me when im upset and not just leave, and she doesnt seem to understand the extent of how im suffering, even when i spell it out. she just doesnt get it. she says she doestn want to say anythig to me becasue alot of the time she says things that are insensitive and it makes me angrier. it does, i guess i just wished she would understand and stop saying things without thinking about them. esp cos im so sensitie. but its not working, maybe its my fault and maybe its not, but either way its not working and we can communicate when im upset and its just up to me to try figure things by myself and i cant cope wit hthat. when i cry or start to cry she just looks away and ignores it, or takes out her phone and starts googling  now. she says its because she doesnt know what ot say or do. but hello, a hug? some kind of comfort? ppl dont always know what, but some kind of comfort would be welcome. i thnk i have said that to her before, that she should tell me il lbeo kay, or hug me or something, and i cant remember what she said. maybe i didnt ask her. idk , i have a fuzzy memory. i dont know . i just know when i cry, she tells me to go away, or just ignores me, or just keeps scrolling on her phone. and she suddenly gets very distant and cold. i dont know. it just sucks. and im sorry if i sound liek some spoilt 4 yr old having  fit. it just sucks and it makes me angry and upset. 6) forgot my other reason. financially i guess. we're not doing well. 7) no one can cope with me, i go to a counsellor and a support group soemtimes, its just not enough , everything is overhwleming me and the ppl i want support from the most cant give it to me. and im all alone at home to just deal with things that icant deal with. so if im gone, then that would be easier on anyone. my mam wont hae to get upset if i give out to her, she wont feel sad and worried taht she doesnt know what to do ( and she is that passive to just feel like that and not try to look for something that could help... but anyways) . so she wont nee to feel guilty anymore. my father, well hes just weird. i dont know bout him. hes not worth it. my brother stopped talking to me when i started worrying alot and need reassurance from him, because i have a really bad self image and i think he just couldnt cope with me being so upst all the time, i dont think he understood how badly my father affected me, even though he went throug the same thing. hes a lot better adjusted than me, so maybe thats why he doesnt understand? i dont know i feel so angry,,... also my friend just said that he thinks i blame my dad for alot of things, it makes me really insecrue and scared that im wrong. because i think my father has alot to do with how i am now and i dont think im being blamey or wrong. he makes it sound like im just refusing to take respnositibilty for how i am. i dont mean that i dont want ot change, i mean like, he thinks i turned out this way because of me or something. oh i dont know. everything is so confusing. and i feel so so angry... thats not good. haha. :/ oops. sigh. i cant wait to see my counsellor next week i think thats bout it... for some reason, when i was younger i always had htoughts of dying as well, but they always went away , then about 2 years ago, for some reason they just started happening more often and everytime i got really upset i would feel like i want to die. doesnt hae to be upset cos of my father, can be antyhing. anyways thanks for letting me vent :D good to get it out Bye!

480@@ I'm a divorced father of one son that means the world to,and I don't see him as much as I wish do to being active military. I was charged with vehicular assault back in 2010 and a dui which I received pre trial diversion.

My depression is at its peak and the soonest I could make an appointment to see someone is 3 weeks awag. So screw me I guess.  My ex wants to take my son away. The military has already categorized me. I have served 10 years honorably. I sometimes wonder if if my son would be better off without me. Nothing excites me anymore with the exception of being around my son. I've thought about suicide for hours but my son is the only thing keeping me from it. I have tried to get help through the military but they are booked up so to speak. I don't want t to kill myself but I'm sick of the pain and tired of feeling lost and confused.  Why me? I'm not a bad person by any means.@@2
481@@ I am so sick and tired of trying to better my life for my daughter and I. I've had countless job interviews and I everytime I go one, I never get the job OR I can't make it to an interview because all of a sudden, everyone becomes busy. I have no help, no babysitter, or money. I still live with my mom and dad. My mom along with my child's father has made the past couple years of my life a living hell and I truly hate them both along with myself. I recently found out from my own child's father's mouth that he slept with over six women while we were together and 4 of them happened while I was pregnant with our daughter. He is now in prison and expects me to wait on him until he gets out next summer. I feel used and like he never loved me to begin with but the only person I can be angry with is myself because there were so many red flags when we first started dating. He still calls me female dogs and has put his hands on me in the past. I am struggling and miserable. I feel like my life will never get better. Everyone tells me it does but I have been going through the same crap for the past 4 years. I love my daughter but I regret getting pregnant because it has made my life harder and it's not like it was already easy to begin with. My mom does not support me whatsoever. I am a way for her to get extra money. I am in school time full time and when my financial aid comes, my mom demands $1000 or more or else she'll put me out. This past semester, she demanded $1500. This fall, she'll be demanding another $1000. I appreciate my parents for letting me live here but everyday, I am walking on eggshells with my own mother. She stills calls me female dogs and I now have a misdemeanor and I am on probation until May of 2016 because of her. It is also getting in the way of me finding a job because I have mandatory appointments that I have to go to or else they'll arrest me again. I was arrested because we got into a huge argument last summer and it was because I was sick of her calling me out of my name and putting me down. It was my word against hers so she told the police to arrest me and they did. Whenever I get a job opportunity, my mom has told me I'm wasting my time because I go on interviews to look at people. She also says it's not like I'm going to work anyway. Then, when we get into an argument, she'll call me lazy and start comparing to other people's grown up children who have jobs, their own place, etc. She'll also start saying how I need to get a job but when I do everything to get one, I have no help from anyone and I have a big family. Before you all say, I need to get help, I'VE BEEN TRYING. I've tried to get help with housing and the waitlist is backed so it'll be a few years before I hear anything. I asked my school about help with finding housing or help and they have yet to tell me anything. I've applied for government assistance but I was turned down because I still live with my parents. I have no one to turn to anymore. I've been praying and it's starting to appear to me that either God hates me or he really just doesn't exist. I am sick and tired of crying, of being depressed, and of feeling like I am a burden. This is truly a cry for help.@@3

Fuck flaky fucking friends.  Fuck ""altruistic"" strangers.  Fuck pity.  Fuck me.  Fuck my lifetime of false ambition.  Fuck my writing.  Fuck my financial bullshit.  Fuck every filthy fucking thread inside me.  Even saying all of this won't help me.  A goddamn platitude-filled number to call won't help me. I didn't go without a fight, but the fight only proved to rub in this defeat even more.  Every time I thought I was finally moving one step aheadâ€”EVERY time, not just most of the time or alot of the timeâ€”I have to find out later that i was ten steps back from anywhere I thought I might have been.  I will never be close to any human being again (if I ever truly was before).  This is the only fact, the only constant, in my life.  Everything else is just a sick lie to try and overlook this.@@5
483@@ Hello, For over 30 years I've been doing this song and dance. I've been peeled like an onion by psychologists and psychiatrists alike. Addressed many things. Desensitized myself to the worst parts. Suicide is a common thought though I've desensitised to it and dismiss it with a thought. But it's a regular occurrence. I've come from using the thought as a whip to it becoming a habitual alternative thought to everything throughout the day. Yet here I am again. I'm only still here due to the efforts of friends and some family. Ironically I feel trapped because of it. Feeling trapped is not a healthy feeling. So I fight the urge to push everyone away. I've been labelled nearly everything under the sun at some point or another. But labels are shit and the Psychiatric profession from my many experiences is hit and miss, largely a joke. I suffer from full blown MDD, likely PTSD as well, which repeats the cycle like clockwork once a year then every few years I get hit by a big one.  I think this is one of those. I spent 5 years medicated in the past. Whilst it helped some of the worst parts, in the long run it did more harm. I become too sedated and it robs me of my core personality. I've loved and lost, I've excelled in my career, I'm generally liked by most of my peers, I feel like I'm past the self pity. I just... don't care. I feel too fragile when things go wrong. Higher peaks seem harder to obtain when the crashing lows are so easily fallen into. I'm sick of the pattern. I'm tired of the cycle. Yet when I try to finish things I can't bring myself to do it yet, much to my own frustration. I guess I post in part because I'm just going through the motions, in part for hope towards some piece of advice which distracts me for a while, in part perhaps to just feel that common connection with similar folk again. Cheers@@2

490@@ It's like... Everyday, I get more reasons to kill myself. Life just doesn't work for me. It's like I'm not cut out for it or something. :( Right now, I'm thinking Why NOT kill myself? Maybe I'll be genuinely happy then.@@2
491@@ The country I live in is literally so disgusting.  For thousands of years humans lived on the Earth with little harm to the Earth. Modern-day slavery Right now, as I am speaking, my existence is thriving on the slavery of hundreds to thousands of human beings.  I haven't met any of the people who have made ALL of the things I own. Some of these things were made in ""economic free zones"" where the US has built sweatshop factories in so-called developing countries in Central America .  These free zones allow the U.S. to ship in raw materials (such a cotton) and hire local residents to assemble products for extremely LOW salaries. ($2-3/day) and then ship the good back OUT of the country, with no taxes, tariffs, trade barriers at all.  Futhermore the U.S. removes income tax from these extremely poor peoples salaries, under the premise that it pays these taxes back to the country's government, however it doesn't even actually pay it back.  Furthermore, the U.S. has also basically stolen most of the fertile land in many countries, which prevents local residents from existing by farming their own food. So we have huge monoculture farms with extremely hazardous conditions such as pesticides, chemical fertilizers which are known to cause bodily harm, birth defects, etc.  Local residents end up working on these farms for also very low salaries, just so they can buy the extremely cheap imported U.S. subsidized GMO food to eat.  these people live paycheck to paycheck and are basically slaves to the U.S. these COUNTRIES are basically U.S. owned slave countries. there is something seriously SICK about the way the world is operating right now.  people are completely ignorant to it all and will only believe fox news and CNN.  Even the food that most people in U.S. eat is poisoned with GMO's, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, steroids, hormones, all of these things are carcinogens which directly are known to cause cancer. you know what else is a carcinogen? most chemotherapy drugs. oh wait lets not forget the fact that everyone in the U.S. drives cars and exists by burning fossil fuels and coal.  even though we have wind and solar technology we are all too stupid to stop buying gas for our cars to instead start using this technology in our homes and are contributing to a huge climate disaster that most people don't even believe is happening.  now we are even using extreme methods to get this precious oil which is destroying the land, such as fracking, refining tar sands oils, etc. what about that fact that the country is founded on genocide? and yet we pretend that never happened, we literally have a day off of work to CELEBRATE the sick sociopath Christopher Columbus who literally tortured, enslaved, raped, killed, and burned alive peaceful indians who gave him anything he asked for. muckrackers who try to share information for free and make the world a better place are convicted and sentenced to prison. (Aaron Swartz) or people who uncover crimes of the U.S. government are being hunted down (Edward Snowden, Julian Assange) there is a never ending list of things that are just extremely fucked up.  a person cannot even just live on a farm and grow food wihtout getting evicted for non-payment of taxes or raided for a ""drug bust"" .  i really just cannot forsee a way of life that would actually be satisfying or worth going through that would be legal for me to even do here.  i could try moving out of the U.S. but i honestly have no idea where i would even go as first i would have to get a job for a corporation working 40/hrs a week to have 20% of my salary stolen by the U.S. government for taxes.  i owe 100,000+ in student loans and honestly, the world is just SO fucked up it is hard to even give a shit about this place.  i am trying to care.  but what is the point.  the more i learn about the world, the more i think it would be a better place if humans were just wiped off the face of the earth in another flood.@@2
492@@ i can't help but think this is the right solution. It's the only one that I come back to. I just logged in to say I am having an even worse day today. I got into an argument with my mother on the way to work. She is determined to help me and that if I just ""listened to her"" all would be well. She is just as much if not more emotionally troubled than I am and is no help at all, but insists that she is. I am starting to feel suicidal now. Last night as I was in bed, I was scared of what I may do to myself. I am so tired of all of these horrible things happening to me. My phone broke this weekend to add to all of what has been going on. I can't afford a new phone now. And the list goes on.......... If I wanted something out of life, I may be tempted to stay, but I don't want anything and I have zero hope at this point for ever figuring any of that out.@@3
493@@ I've contemplated suicide many times in my life. I'm only the age of 25, but the earliest time I've considered I believe was around the age of 10. Thinking back, It could have mainly been a cry for help or attention. I lived a mostly depressing childhood due to family problems. Honestly? I'm not really sure what I plan to get out of typing this story, but it will contain things I've never been open to talk about with many people. I'm not even expecting people to read or care about what I'm typing...I would just like to type out my thoughts and feelings for my own sake. Since I was a child, I grew up in an abusive household. My father was very verbally and physically abusive, and my mother and sister was a victim of it as well. We grew up an average family in terms of wealth, maybe even below average. My father was my greatest fear and most hated person, and though I loved my mother, I never understood her or what she went through. As a child, I grew to hate her as well for allowing the things that went on in our household to happen. Though, she attempted to help in her own way. She's very religious and pushed me and my sister to be so as well, so her prayer was her form in trying to cure our family problems. I too used to believe that God would make everything ok, and would care for us, but I have a different mentality than I used to have as a child. I was pressured and mostly forced to join into many church organizations, where the only time I would voluntarily be a part of is when I knew a girl that I had a crush on would be going. Afterall, growing up I feel that music and a need to feel loved was a major goal while I was a kid. I spent most of my childhood trying to understand God, and what his plans were, and attempting with a child's brain to rationalize my family's situation into something God would want to happen to show us his love. Needless to say, I spent a lot of my childhood being angry at God, while claiming to love him and foolishly believing that he loves me as well...or that he even existed. Out of my Father, Mother, and Sister, my Sister was the only one I ever felt truly connected to. We were both known as the black sheep out of all of my other family members only because we didn't act as stereotypical as the rest of them, and we understood that was because we were more intelligent and had different hobbies than them. At a very young age, my Sister was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes, which as the younger sibling not really understanding the situation, I was always fearful for my sister's health. I grew up thinking at any moment she could easily die, but I guess that was due to the lack of information my parents gave me about her illness. Growing up, I was a shy kid, not really able to make many friends, much less girlfriends. I was always late on trends, wasn't the most attractive (in my eyes), and majorly socially awkward. I didn't have many friends to hang around, and never learned to get close enough to others to hang out with them outside of school. I would spend my days either alone, desperately trying to cling to my sister, or with a very few cousins who I were close enough to to enjoy spending time with. One of those cousins, who was a year older than me, learned before I did what Sex was. Being younger, more naive, and in desperate need to feel loved and accepted by the little amount of friends I have, he was easily able to manipulate me into performing sexual acts with him. It was taboo at the time, sex, and learning about pleasure. I knew that it was looked down upon for same-sex relationships, and I heard of the word ""Gay"" before. Though, I willingly did these sexual acts with him, which began in elementary some year. Over the years, as I learned more about sex, I grew more uncomfortable with the situation...but that certain cousin was always, in my mind, better than me. He was very talented in school, perfect grades with more difficult classes. He was very amiable, attractive, popular, and most of all, very manipulative. I wouldn't go as far as to claim that I was ever raped, since It was my decision overall to engage in the sexual acts just to feel approval from him, whom I was envious of. Over time, i we would mask the homosexuality of it by acting out as if we were different people (roleplay if you will), which helped to overcome the uncomfortable feeling of what I knew I was unsure about. I didn't feel myself as ""Gay"" at that time, though I couldn't rule out that option due to the activities. I didn't necessary feel attracted to boys, that was just something that has went on for years, which I wasn't very fond of. Over time, nearing and going into highschool, I learned to subtly reject his advances, which would only work half of the time. Once he would become more forceful (not violently), I would sometimes give in under pressure. When sleeping next to him in sleepovers, if he would wake and try to start sexual activities, I would pretend to still be asleep to avoid them. After a while, I simply stopped hanging around him. He was a jackass even more so than he was a manipulator, and that's saying a lot. Going back, during junior high, my Father and Mother split during my 1st year in 7th Grade. One morning, I woke to my mother crying, her sending me off to a relative that i wasn't very fond of. Later that day, I was told that my Father was arrested for sexual molesting my older sister for years, who was then around the age of 15-16. Shocked and filled with even more pure hatred from my father, who emotionally and physically abused me all of my life, I wanted one thing from. His death. I took a vow that I would one day kill my father in revenge to what he's done to our family. Those were some of the most confusing times of my life, and my passive-aggressive nature still has me clueless about the full details. Basically, I was told that my father would not go to prison if my Mother, My sister, and I were willing to let him be free but undergo therapy and a retraining order from him seeing me and my sister. I wanted him to rot in prison. I hated him, as I said before...but my Sister and my Mother still very much loved him. Before I got to make my decision, I seen that my Sister and my Mother had already forgave him and didn't want him to live so many years in prison, but If i gave the word, he would. In some self-less act, even though I never wanted to see him again, I agreed to have him be free, like my Mother and Sister wanted. The night that I was told about the event, my father was supposed to be away from our home. I was dropped off home briefly to gather some clothes thinking I was home alone, but little did we know, my father was in the house. It was the 1st and only time I seen my father so weak and pathetic, and it frightened me to no end. He saw me, and we both literally froze. He burst into tears, and grabbed me into a deep hug, apologizing. Saying over and over how sorry he was. I just stood there. Not crying. Trembling, almost emotionless. Not knowing how to react. He let go of me and went to his room while I finished packing. I never told my family he was there that night, I was sure I wasn't supposed to see him and maybe he wasn't even supposed to be there at that time. I stayed at my cousins house that night (the one mentioned before), and I cried myself to sleep, thinking that I'd wake up and it would all be a dream again. I hated God very much in those times. Due to the stress of my father being arrested as a pedophile who molested my sister, and the other stress issues of dealing with therapy and living at home with a destroyed mother and an equality destroyed sister, my subpar grades dropped to an all time low. That year, I was also introduced to bullying. A group of peers whom I thought I was friends with, decided to make me their easy target to beat up and pick on every day during P.E. The coaches I had at that time literally did not care, just seen it as ""boys being boys"". I was literally be beat up on and/or jumped every day in the locker room, being called names like ""faggot"" and ""bitch"". I had to learn to try to avoid them the best I could, and just laugh it off as if we were all playing some sort of game that I voluntarily let myself be in. I had one new friend at that time that asked me why do I allow it, and though the real answer was ""because nobody cares about me"", i told him it was all just fun and games, and that I didn't really mind. I tried to believe that God loved me again to cope with the sexual abuse from my cousin, the bullying from my peers, the declining in my grades, my father being taken away from molesting mys sister, and an almost dead like mother and sister who didn't know how to interact with me. Around that time, my sister was growing up, no longer wanting to be around her little brother. Back then, she was the only person I ever truly relied on, and having her basically shun me for her new friends made me feel the deepest alone I ever felt before during that time. I had absolutely no one, is how I felt. I would play with any toys I could by myself, to try to cope.@@1
494@@ Guess I'm back here.......again.  Been thinking of this off and on.  Been a part of this forum since like 2006.  And to be honest, I feel stupid that I'm still here.  Speaking of honesty....here's one.  When I first came here, I was looking for a way to end things.  As painlessly as possible.  Someone here named Irishred talked to me and for the first time in a long time, someone reached back to talk to me about why I didn't want to be here anymore.  So long story short, I stuck around .....to see if things would get better.  To see if all I needed was a bit more time. My worst fears are growing old alone with no one to share life with.  No family to enjoy.  And no decent job to be independent.  I know there are far worse things out there to experience which would make you want to end things.  But these two are at the top of my list right now.  And guess what?  NOTHING's changed!  Its been 8 fucking years.....and I'm right back to square one.  Along the way I've made friends here, along the way I've helped others, seen people come and go.  Was fortunate enough to be thanked for my helped and I am grateful for the help I have received. I know this thread will not garner much response, but I guess putting things down is better than coming up with a plan for the moment.  Even then I am unsure.  I mean why not?  I'm a bit worse off than when I started.  And before you tell me getting a decent job is fixable......I was hurt in a car accident and cant do physical labor and have little skill in other things despite being college educated.  My meager income consists of selling things on ebay.  And yes...not having income not only whittles at my self esteem, but it just kills me as a person.  I'm a very giving person and enjoy treating my friends and family out as much as buying things for myself.  And this is not saying that im some sort of big spender either. Right here, right now....all I do day after day is exist.  That's it.  I don't participate in life.  I just pray each day that I can come up with my car payment and not burden my parents more than I already am.  It is no way to live.  And I want out.@@3
495@@ Twice already its happened again. I've been thrown back to that state of completely desperation. I thought that I was able to keep it at bay but the more I restraint it, the stronger it grows. My mind rushes, telling me all the reasons why not to keep going. I can't stop myself from breaking down and the desire to end it taunts me. Often its said to think about who is left behind but I find that a selfish though as any because it is precisely those people who would be left behind the ones who push things. The ones who make your life a living hell and were supposed to think of them!? Why don't they think of us? If  they see us, they see that we can't take it and yet still push telling us we have to do it. Why should we place them before ourselves?@@4
496@@ I'm exhausted.  I just want to die.  But my family would be devestated.  I have a 9 year old sister and she is going through a very hard time, how will she cope with news about me dying?  Not even to mention my fiance.  I used to be this inspirational person, but I've just crashed over and over again and I just can't seem to get up anymore.  i feel like I'm in the way of everyone even though they won't admit it or don't want to face the fact that I'm just dragging them down.  I feel so selfish for wanting to die, I've made so many suicide plans, but how can I leave everyone behind with my mess, of cleaning up after me?  I wish something would happen so that I didnt have to make it happen, because I just can't face anything anymore.  I don't want to go on, I'm beyond utter exhaustion, physically, mentally and financialy.  We've spent tens of thousands of rands trying to get me treatment, for my medication and hospital bills.  i had to quit my job because I was unable to work anymore.  I was actually sleeping on the dirty tile floor in the bathroom where I locked myself in before work and during lunch times just to get through a day.  I don't want to self pity, I don't want to anything anymore.  I just want to disappear and have nobody even notice.  i don't want to feel anymore.  Why can't that happen?  Why couldn't I just be normal and happy like an average person?  i can't talk to anybody about it because people just get mad at me for feeling this way.  And I've been fighting this for years and years.  I've hidden it away so well that nobody could see it for years.  But I feel like i don't have any fight left in me. Why won't it stop??  Why won't it go away???@@3
497@@ Im 30 years old, I have 4 incredible children. I have an amazing and extremely beautiful fiancÃ©e. I drink. I want to stop. I cannot. I do not know why. Rehab does not work. My drinking makes me more vulnerable to depressive moods. Which considering my past is NOT a good thing. What choice is left? Every time I have a drink I see a piece of  my fiancÃ©e die. Every time I drink I see my children seeing what I saw growing up. Every time I leave them to attend rehab I feel further from all of them. I spent 2 years doing rehab once and when I came out my kids didn't recognize me. Why do I have this affliction? Why cant I stop even though I completely understand the harm its causing? What the FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME?! I want my children to have a father but that's exactly what i want them to have. Not a degenerate drunk fucken hopeless piece of shit. Im at the end of my tether. Can anyone help?@@5
498@@ I have made other posts in this section before, I only do that when things get too much for me to handle. It's all just one long miserable story, one that I have done absolutely everything possible to steer away from it, but it's almost as if I was doomed to misery. 10 years ago, I thought I'd never be where I am today. I always thought things are gonna get better, but they don't. they only get worse. I don't see a future for me, I had a miserable childhood, and my life is not doing any better right now. I'm tired. I can't carry on any longer, I pray not to wake up every time I go to sleep, I don't want to end my own life.. I'm scared of Hell. It's the only thing I think about all day long, I just try to hide it and act normal, I'm acting normal for the sake of my family. I even thought about who will find me and I can't do this to them. I wish I could just disappear. I don't know why I'm posting this, it is not a goodbye note or anything im just so desperate and drained and exhausted. it has never been so compelling@@4
499@@ Does anybody want to die simply because you're just fucking bored to death? I don't and have never had a bad life (aside from being bullied in highschool) but yet I just have this overwhelming hatred of everything about it. Like, I can't be bothered with any of it. I don't want to work, go to college, or make friends, or have any kind of social life. I just want to be dead : When people say to me ""I'm bored to death"" I just look at them like, yeah...you don't even know the of that phrase. -_- I'm just full of so much anger and hatred for everything and everyone. I don't know why. And I don't enjoy anything, everything's fucking boring and dull to me. I'm so tired of feeling like this. I don't understand why the fuck I was put on this earth when I so badly don't want to be here. If there is a God, why on earth does he give life to people like me who don't even want it? I'm so tired. I want to die but I'm too afraid of death and what might happen afterwards. The only escape from it all is glorious sleep...@@3
500@@ I'm only 17 years old, and I've been wanting to kill myself since I was 16. Now that is sad. What kind of teen/kid even should be thinking about harming themselves. I believe God put us here on this world for a reason. And we are wanting to take our lifes, it's just not fare. But I honestly can't take it no more. Every time I'm alone which is when I'm at home. I get really depressed and start thinking of the past, and it just hurts. I wish I could talk to someone. I told my mother that I wanted depressing pills but she told me I didn't need them, because my brother was wanting to kill himself at my age too but he didn't. She is the worst mother ever she doesn't even try and find out what is wrong with me or anything. I mean if my kids had the guts to tell me that there life wasn't good and they didn't feel like living anymore I would hear them out. I wouldn't just let leave them harming themselves because that would just hurts me. I'll just say everything here since I won't and never will have anyone else to talk to like this. I don't think I deserve to leave because my life has been fucked up ever since day one. My mom was never really a mother and well my father was even worse. I get attracted or become friends with the wrong people -- nevermind I don't even think I can do this because I'm scared of one of my friends finding out about this article. I don't know maybe when I turn 18, I can save up enough money and talk to someone about my problems. I just hope I don't do anything stupid from here and now on.@@3
501@@ I recently attempted suicide and was taken to a local hospital in an ambulance from my school. I've been taking medicine for depression and anxiety. The medicine worked for about three months, then my symptoms of depression came back (voices, suicidal thoughts, etc). My mom was always supportive and said I can tell her anything. We had two family members pass away before my attempt, which was why I didn't tell my parents that my medicine wasn't working anymore. About a week or two after my attempt I noticed my new medicine just seemed to make everything worse. I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed. It took every bit of my energy to even sit up. I had constant suicidal thoughts and just felt as if I was living to die. My parents were very angry with me for not helping out around the house or cleaning my room. I decided that I should tell them how I was feeling and that I was having suicidal thoughts. After a few minutes of telling my mom how I felt (useless, not going anywhere in life, living to die, etc), she started getting very angry with me. She ended up saying that I'm ungrateful because I have so much and I have no reason to really be depressed. She told my that all of the therapy and my attempt was going to come up on my record and that I'm just f*****g my life up. My dad also came in after about 10 minutes and said ""you're to young to be depressed. You have nothing to be depressed about."" (I'm 15.) Then he told me ""your little episode cost $6,000 and now people are going to look at us as terrible parents"". I understand that they are upset that I made them look bad, but they seem to care more about how they look than my mental stability. I feel as if I can't talk to them or finish telling them that my meds don't work. Anytime I try to talk about it, they just get angry and make me seem ungrateful. I would like to talk to my school counselor about having suicidal thoughts and such, but I'm not sure how. I've never talked to her before. I don't know what to do anymore. The voices are getting worse and the suicidal thoughts are just getting stronger. I feel as if I should go to the local mental health institution, but my parents would just be worried about the cost (even though insurance covers most of it). What should I do?@@1
502@@ Every single thing I decide to do there is always a huge obstacle in my path. Financially always something. Im 22 and have not accomplished anything. My home life, my relationship is just freaking BS. I think of ways to commit suicide. I have nothing and I have no one. Nobody sees the good I do for them ever. maybe its just me. Im sick of my life. I wanted to be someone great. I wanted to help the world, help the children that have nothing or help the women in india. Im stuck financially. I made the biggest mistake by moving back to my parents house. Now I have no money because I worked for them and didn't get paid. I motivated myself to study but thats not working out great cos I cant pay my fees. I mean everything was perfect on Friday. This is my life, for as long as I can remember not one single thing worked out in my favour. The person that I actually really like is more then 20,000 km away. I have no money to go see him, I'l never have him. My friends, 2 people I considered my best friends. One hasnt contacted me since 3 weeks ago and the other one called me so much just to tell me how her brother is intelligent, how shes having a good time at work. Pretty much to brag about herself. And thats just how she is, but I just didnt wanna talk to anyone for 2 weeks because Im having troubles I just wanted to be alone. She decided to stop talking to me. I dont even know what kind of people are in the world. Im done fighting. I have no more strength to fight. Nothing is worth fighting for.@@5
503@@ Does anyone suffer with suicidal urges that you can't control? I've driven myself crazy trying to surpress them for years and I can't do it anymore. I just get no joy out of life whatsoever.@@2
504@@ The only thing I see when I look into my future is suicide. I can't picture my life any different. I can't picture it ""getting better"" since my problems aren't temporary. Once suicide enters your thoughts once, it returns every sp often. It becomes your go to thought when something bad happens. I can only imagine how I'll act when something huge happens... I know for sure, I'm gone. Every problem or feeling or even small stuff like getting in a fight with a family member could just be that extra push.  ""Suicide is just permanent solution to a temporary problem"", depression, loneliness, self hate, seclusion and complete emptiness have never been a temporary problem. The temporary problems just makes the permanent ones so much harder to maintain and control. And that's what causes suicide. The true way to suicide prevention is to know how to maintain and control in lifes shitty situations and I think they should teach us how to do that in therapy. Taking care of the permanent problems will not lead temporary ones to push someone over the edge. Therapy has only ever taught me to understand myself, not how to control myself. People don't get that suicide, after being attempted once, will become the immediate escape route for those who can't handle it anymore. The thoughts never go away. Even if  I went to college nd started a family because that's only solving a temporary problem. I always give myself an excuse, ""no, the kids will come home from school and find you"", ""no, your Dad will be devasted if you do it right before his wedding"", I'm almost positive, if I ever live alone, it will be done... And it's a scary thought that I can't trust myself, with myself. If anyone has overcome these thoughts, I'd really love to know how.@@3
505@@ I don't know why things snowball so badly for me. This afternoon I got a call from my social anxiety support group leader about what my ""experiment"" would be in our next group session. Everything we talked about either seemed pointless or beyond my abilities. The stuff I felt like I was working on seemed useless. Things just got worse from there. By 5:00, when I was done with work, I just felt myself getting lower and lower. I had planned on going to a college baseball game after work. It took a lot for me to even get on the subway in the direction of the game. When I got to my final destination I was really tempted to hop on the next train back home. Somehow I kept walking. It's (normally) about a 20 minute walk from the subway station to the ballpark. I knew there was a convenience store on the way, so I tried to bribe myself with junk food. Just get to the store, I thought. Get some candy and a soda and see how you feel. I moved really slowly. Everything I looked at seemed to bring on bad feelings. It took a lot to keep myself moving forward. I got my junk food and it gave me some temporary relief. I decided to keep walking. Within minutes it became hard again. I was still moving very slow. Thankfully hardly anyone was around. I was just alone in a big open area on the college campus walking like an 80 year old with bad hips. It got harder to keep going. I was only about a 5 minute walk from the ballpark when I finally stopped. Among all the shitty thoughts I had, I looked around the college and thought to myself ""I don't want to ever go back to college. I can't fucking do it."" Going back to school has always been a painful thought for me. That thought made me think of my social anxiety group, and how I felt like I couldn't do that. I felt like I couldn't do anything to make things better. I badly wanted to sit down just for a minute. Just a few minutes from the ballpark I stopped and sat down. I really thought I was done. I thought ""this is it. This is my high water mark. This is as far as I can go to help myself. I just don't have it in me to keep going."" I wanted to go home, but it crossed my mind that if I did go home, I would just feel suicidal. I may even attempt it. I decided to get up and keep walking to the park. I finally got there. I sat alone for 3 innings before leaving. I just had no interest in the game. I didn't feel as low as I had earlier, but my mood was still wavering. I started going home, with a few pit stops for junk food. The suicidal thoughts haven't left. I fought back tears several times when walking around. When I got home I really lost it. I got close to calling the suicide hotline, which I've never done before. I really feel like I've lost. I can't change. I can either keep suffering or give up.@@4
506@@ I've read articles, sat through 2 hours of counselling, been told over and over, and realized... I am suicidal/depress..... This month..... my emotional state has made me unable to think clearly most of the time.... I am going to be honest, and straight to the point...... and I'm telling this because I am afraid I might do something and i want to stop myself... 3 weeks ago I self harmed. So that's one shit I really regret doing. Next. I randomly text my friend about how sorry I am throughout the years we've known each other and how much sorry I am if i was going to do something so reckless and didnt want her to feel responsible or anything, and I wanted her to relay the message to our other friends if i ever just left. I honestly want to say how sorry I am to them, and hoped they wouldn't feel bad if I'm gone. My hair, I have long hair and I really like it. I love making my hair into a bun, which always made me happy for some stupid reason. And yes, you've guess it. I had it cut. So goodbye long hair. That's the third. The forth one, it has been bothering me, I've decided if I failed a certain subject, I wont enroll anymore. (I'm failing 8 out of 10 subjects)... I'm wasting money, I shouldn't even have this privilege... My birthday is just a couple of days away... and I feel like, I want everything to be joyful(I'm sorta having a party with my friends)........ I hope everyone would have a great time, and forget me..... What am I going to do with myself? I can't keep this routine any longer..... I don't want therapy.... I'm too afraid to speak out about how i feel..... I'm so sick of school, I'm sorry..... I dont really know what I'm trying to ask for or trying to accomplish here.... i'm not going to kill myself, i dont have the guts to do it.... but the thought of unable to do it, makes me want to just give up on life and just be a useless piece of trash.... I am literally killing myself slowly and it's very painful.... i'm no masochist, but i deserve this pain....@@3
507@@ This is where I'm at. also very depressed.  Number 1 I am tired of my physical pain, it is getting worse, especially with this cold weather and I don't know what to do, I was just turned down for medicaid and I do not qualify for medicare because of the two year waiting period for medicare. Also there are disagreements in my marriage that are not yet fixed and I'm afraid some of them never will be since it is just my husband's personality. I know he won't change and neither will I on some issues. We do compromise on some things but still we have issues. I have thought of leaving, but it terrifies me, I'm scared to be on my own and I have always been this way I think its part of my disability and I am scared to meet someone else since where still married. You see... No way out of this life. I'm just so depressed and I have no one to talk to that is why I joined this site, to get it on paper and out of my brain. Hopefully it will help me not to do anything foolish. I also want you to know that I do have a really good husband are disagreements are never fights. Sometimes we just agree to disagree but there are some things I want to do with my life that he would just never do. That's a good way to explain it in short.@@3
508@@ Hi I'm MrsLoser, heh seems appropriate. I joined this forum to try and stop these suicidal feelings.  Someone to talk to I guess or just to vent anonymously.  I don't really have anyone in ""real life"" that I feel I can say such things to.   I am married (happily for the most part) and he is great but he doesn't know how to ""handle"" someone with depression.  He only gets mad when I bring it up.  The only other person I feel I could talk to is my mom, who is weaker in nearly every sense of the word.  I don't mean that in a negative way, just that she is in poor health and has suffered a lot and has been suicidal herself in the past.  I cannot trouble either of these people with the darkest parts of my mind. I have other family but I really truly honestly know that none of them would even be bothered if I ""left this world"".  Well, not in any real sense, they'd feel bad because everyone does when someone dies, or even guilty for a bit because they weren't really there but no one's lives would be burdened or even affected beyond that aside from these two people (my husband and my mom). I also have friends, but none of them are really real friends.  Due to things in my past and such strong self-hatred and anger and depression I have secluded myself from everything and everyone to my own detriment.  So, I really don't have any friends. I think this is a last ditch effort to find a way to release since I have no one to talk to.  I cannot see any doctors since I have no insurance, so medication is also out of the question. I am sorry if I bother anyone here or do something wrong.  Just needing to vent.  I usually cut myself when I need to vent but it doesn't seem enough anymore and today actually sat down and started researching ways for a quick, easy, cheap way out.  That is until I realized all I really want is someone to talk to.@@5
509@@ I'm 24 I have been suffering from depression since my teenage years, I've never actually seeked for help at all. About a year and 3 months I ago I decided that I really want to die so I did something that is still causing me pain. I really want to die but I don't want to cause too much pain to my family since I had to bury my mom just a month ago.....the pain gets worse everyday what should I do@@2
510@@ Don't really want to restart a new thread. We're all lost; if we were drowning, we'd be yelling at each other and hanging on to the hands around us. I'm so tired I keep slipping down under the waves, desperate not to bring somebody down with me. I am so tired now. I really don't know if I am going to die. I only know I am not living. I think of all the times I planned, and survived suicide. And ""what's trending now"" seems to be the civil right to suicide. It is so easy, easier to pull the plug than find a path into another day. If I get on that road--a road that makes it ethical to end the exhaustion and the darkness and the inadequacy--it's easy, more effective than last time. Last time, as I blearily recall, I lived through it.@@2
511@@ I'm not going to do it now, but I've long thought eventually I'd decide to. A year from now, ten years from now, on my deathbed, at some point I'll decide I want to end it myself. This is the first time in a long time I've thought about this. These feelings had gone away for a long time yet here I am again. As just talking to a friend online (of course not in real life) they said: ""things will be better tomorrow. I just gave the reply I'll have to update every year for the rest of my life: ""It's been like this for the better part of 8 years.@@2
512@@ Hello and thank you for taking the time to read this. I have resolved not to directly take my life because I don't want to hurt the people that care for me but I live every moment of my life wanting nothing but to die to the point that it hurts just to exist. I will continue to try to do my best not to kill myself but it hurts terribly to live like this and I was hoping I could find knowledge out there to possibly not hurt so bad when feeling like I am only living so people I care for won't hurt. I don't want anything from this life anymore and have a bleeding wound where the only thing I really wanted used to be. I only ever found one thing that gave me a future I cared about and real happiness to live this life and that was the happiness of a specific person. The only thing I wanted out of this life was to marry her, keep her smiling, have babies with her and keep them happy. She died unexpectedly in my arms and I just don't want anything else from this world (I didn't want anything else before it happened either). The superficial circumstances of my life have never been terrible. I am aware of other things in life and I have done many things. I have traveled and seen many places. I do not suffer monetary hardships. I am adept or quickly become adept at anything I do. I am attractive even after losing 20+ pounds in not caring to eat. All that said none of it is enough to make me look forward to waking up, the good circumstances of my life do not numb the pain of the hole inside of me and losing the only future I ever cared to have. I do my best and typically succeeded at not talking to the people I care about regarding this because I feel it's a unfair burden to put in their minds but I have sought mental health help, as well as just recently called a help line. I am very good at taking things apart and figuring out how they work, how they will work, problems and solutions and I have came up with nothing that helps me wake up and not wan't this to be over. I advised the mental health professional and the help line that I am intent on not killing myself but I want to die constantly and was just looking for maybe something I missed in my trying to help myself in living like this. The mental health professional after some talking with me agreed that I am not dealing with an irrational or chemical depression and didn't have anything which would help my processed conclusion. My talk with the help line personnel ended the same way and I have stumbled upon this forum in hopes someone has something I may have missed to make staying alive just so other people won't hurt not hurt me so bad. This isn't as clear or concise as I was hoping to make itâ€¦ I hope it isn't bumbling and I thank you again for reading it.@@2
513@@ I read something on someone's blog, and it kinda stuck with me. I don't want to commit suicide, I don't want to kill myself, but, I wish I could just be dead It's a terribly confusing feeling/thought, but somehow that's how it is. Of course I can't be dead without committing suicide, but I wish that somehow it would be possible. Realising this, I begun to feel stuck. Between wanting to die but not being able to kill myself, and going on and on and on and continue living like a zombie. What to do?!?! I wish I could just dissolve and be gone.@@3
514@@ I am new here, I am thinking very seriously about ending my life. I ran my own business for years and I got so far behind with the IRS there is no way for me to ever make enough money to pay them back in my lifetime. I am 59 years old, have suffered form depression most of my adult life. I would rather take my life then to spend a day in prison. I feel like I got to do many things in my life and I have had what appears to most to be a good life and it has been. I never married and have no children. I do have three sisters that would have to deal with the loss of my life. I don't blame anyone but myself for the poor choices I made in not trying to deal with the IRS sooner. I just received a letter form the IRS and they want to audit me and my business. I really don't see another way out of this mess. I have very little money because my business went in to the tank when the economy crashed. I am a building contractor and have not had any work for two years. So you are the first people to know of my dilemma. I really am ready to go. I don't want to spend a day behind bars after living a free live for almost 60 years. I would love to hear any of your thoughts on this. I have actually considered moving to another country like Cambodia and live there as cheap as possible for as long as I can. Cambodia won't extradite you back to the USA. Is there anyone out there that has any brighter ideas than I have come up with? Please don't tell me that prison life is not all that bad and it beats being dead. Thanks in advance Scared as hell. Ready2go.@@4
515@@ I'm really hating life. It all seems pretty pointless. My life just seems a waste of time. I'm hear on this earth, but only God knows why. I feel useless, like my life means nothing to anyone. I've often pictured my funeral. I've thought about what it would be like. One things for certain, I wouldn't have many people at my funeral. The only people I'd have there, would most likely be my family. My dad, mum, sister, two nans, and uncle. That's 6 people. Make's you feel really important to have that many people there. But then again, that's me, I'm not important. Nobody care's about me, not really. I wish killing yourself, could be easy. No question, I'd do it. I really don't feel I have that much to live for. If I can't kill myself, I'd like it if I could just disappear. If I could just cease to exist. Just a sudden POOF and I'd be gone, just like magic. Alas, real life doesn't give you what you want in a simple way. If it were simple I'd be gone already. I don't know how to stop feeling like this. I really do need help =(@@4
516@@ I really want to kill myself and feel like my family would be better off without me wising i could make this pain go away but it seems like nothing is working anymore@@5
517@@ I'm pretty sure you all know the feeling. You convince yourself that it's just today,tonight, then in the morning it will all get better. It's all to much to deal with alone. With hope, x@@4
518@@ This past holiday i survived a suicide attempt *barely*. I got out of having to be commited in a mental hospital, and I came home to hostile family. Some backstory on me, i am married and one kid (13) and living with my husbands grown son. I have made some of the worse choices in my life, and just seem to get even worse as time goes on. One of which is my marriage, moving to texas, and giving up my life for his children/family. I come from a very broken home and all I wanted was a family. I never got that. My husband and I have no relationship at all, I told him when I got out of the hospital that he was a huge source of stress for me and he said ""no hes not"" and started a fight on night one of being back home. My step son yelled at me ""who gives you the right to walk in here like nothing happened"" again on night one of being home after surviving self attempted suicide. /sigh I have been in love with someone of my husbands family that actually knew how to treat me, now he wants to have a normal life and doesn't want me in it. I held on to that close friendship/crush for over 6 years. I heart is broken twice over, for being in a loveless, emotionally dead marriage. For the one person in this world my heart was bound too is walking out of it. My husband doesnt know I feel that way about him. He has had his own stuff going on with women on the internet. Im miserable, not loved and not wanted cept to clean up thehouse and cook ever so often. My son didn't even get a rats that i was home from the hospital. I know I didn't and shouldnt have gotten pregnant and marriage to someone I didn't know I was not in love with. I wasn't raised with love at all, I still only know how to feel crushes and lust and pain I want to be happy with someone even though I feel like a burden and that I have nothing to give. I write this, tears flowing down my face. I know I deserve what I got for being stupid. I came home from surviving suicide to a hostile house. I wish I didn't survive, and I back where I started wanting to do it again. I have no family here to stay with and no one in the world to talk too. no one that would miss me there is other drama but I hurt too much to write anymore I'm sorry in advance I broke a forum rule since I am new. have a nice day@@3
519@@ I'm being observed, they really upped their game. Don't they know that I've tried suicide before.  If they keep it up it will happen again, this time I won't fail. I have documentation, pictures I hope my family goes after them and makes out big time.@@4
520@@ Tomorrow is my birthday. There will be no party. I tried a month before to arrange to have this day off but my boss forgot or didn't think it was all that important and scheduled me to go in. I live with my husband, daughter, and her boyfriend. My husband and my daughter have part-time employment. Her boyfriend has none. My husband is sitting beside me on his computer, he will say next to nothing all night. I bought my own birthday cake. My sisters will text me happy birthday. There will be no presents. I hate myself. I hate being poor, I hate being ignored and I hate that nothing will change no matter what I say. I hate being an American middle aged woman.@@5
521@@ I feel like a big burden to my mother and older brother because of my goddamn emotional problems. I feel like shit. I think I should die...@@4
522@@ I am a survivor of a recent attempt, and every since I have been home no one seems to want me here. They just want me to leave them alone and do household things I do. I do what they don't or can't learn to do. I need a therapist to help but none have appts available in the mornings. I have no transpertation, no job, can't qualify for ssdi, I just feel like a burden to this family my son is almost 14 and didnt even care when I came back from the hospital. I have someone that just broke my heart and coming home with him here is hard as well. I'm sure none of this makes any since, I have this jerry springer household going on lol I just want to be done, this hurts so much, no amount of meds help either@@3
523@@ I'm really frightened and I don't know what to do. I'm can't stop crying. I tried to phone a help line. They told me to call back because they were busy. Sorry, that's loose and non-specific, but I don't know what else to say.@@5
524@@ I just want someone to hear my voice before I die. I donâ€™t want to tell people I know how I feel this time, because theyâ€™ll blame themselves if I die. Theyâ€™ll probably blame themselves regardless. Iâ€™ve fought so hard not to kill myself, for the sake of the people around me who donâ€™t have a clue what I go through for them. Iâ€™ve driven people away because I donâ€™t want to hurt them. I survive this for them, but no one gives a shit anymore because of everything Iâ€™ve put them through. Iâ€™ve thought about killing myself every day for over ten years. I donâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t had the balls to do it yet. Everyone I know is desensitized to my threats and tears and drunken fits, because Iâ€™ve been so depressed for so long theyâ€™re sick of hearing about it, sick of looking after me. Iâ€™ve talked about my issues a thousand times, with friends, family, counsellors, doctors, psychiatrists. They canâ€™t help me. Not their words or their meds. I still keep trying, still keep turning up to my appointments, still swallow my pills. I donâ€™t know why. None of it makes any difference, I can hardly move and I havenâ€™t had a moment of respite for as long as I can remember. I canâ€™t do anything, I canâ€™t work, I canâ€™t sleep, I hardly talk, I canâ€™t even watch TV or read a book because it hurts too much. I canâ€™t smile. I canâ€™t fucking breathe. All I do is lie in bed, sometimes cry, occasionally eat some junk food.  I can rarely be bothered drinking or getting high, and it only makes me worse in the end anyway so I try to avoid it. I canâ€™t really look after myself but I try to clean myself and my place up when someone comes around so they donâ€™t put me in hospital. Iâ€™m completely incapacitated. Iâ€™ve tried so hard. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to find it in me to keep trying this time. The worst part is, I want to live. Just not like this. Iâ€™ve tried to have hope, but after all this time I have to accept that this way of survival is my only option. If my choice is between this and death, I have to choose to die. Still, I keep surviving and hoping. I want a normal life, but Iâ€™m not capable of it. Iâ€™m giving up, Iâ€™m letting go. Iâ€™m broken beyond repair. Iâ€™ve never been okay. Iâ€™ve just gotten more and more depressed as life has destroyed me. Amongst losing a child, being raped, the love of my life leaving me, and all the blood on my hands, thereâ€™s no hope on the horizon. Iâ€™ve done so many things Iâ€™m ashamed of; I can never reclaim any kind of dignity or innocence. I pray for absolution, beg forgiveness for the mistakes Iâ€™ve made. I think God would see my suicide for what it is. This depression is an illness like any other, should I be condemned for dying from it? Not that I could ever be forgiven for everything else anyway, so what would one more mortal sin matter in the end? Add it to my tally. I canâ€™t live with what Iâ€™ve done. I canâ€™t live like this. No one could ever love me for what I am, no one understands what it is to live with these horrors. I just hope that, if do I finally take my life, the people around me will see it for the mercy that it is. Sorry this is so depressing. And long. Thanks for reading.@@4
525@@ I haven't logged in here for a while, but I'm not feeling too great and my best and worst enemy, sitting alone with my thoughts, is taking advantage of me.  I've been working hard on getting better, but my coping skills are unhealthy and I feel like I'm just brainwashing myself that things are 'better'.  I am truly alone right now.  I just cut ties with the last person that cares because of a third party who makes the situation very unhealthy.  I wish they would leave that situation too, but they won't because they don't want to deal with the consequences.    Everyone has dreams of what makes life worth living, and right now I see a 0% chance of achieving my dreams.  Zero may seem exaggerating, but there are many things I can't go into that makes that zero a reality.  I just don't like where my brain is going right now.  I take 10 unisom pills a day still to make me fall asleep.  I love sleep.  Maybe to some it seems illogical, but when I look at the pros and cons of death, there are a ton more pros than cons on my list.  To me right now, it seems logical that if the pros of life aren't worth the cons, then why do it?  That's what my brain does and I can't find a good answer.@@4
526@@ All I think about is how much better everyone would be without me. I just mess things up and am nothing but a drain on my family and society in general. If I wasn't so afraid of more pain I think I already would have committed suicide. I don't know what to do any more.@@4
527@@ I don't know what to do@@1
528@@ I noticed some things make my depression and suicidal mood come back more stronger than it ever was. It's binging and being sick. I am sick with the flu second time in the last 2 months. I have aches all over my body, pain in my chest and severe sore throat. I can't lay still in bed, my mind can't make peace with the fact that the time is not being used productively. My roommate is adding to the pain. She doesn't talk much to me, I get every word out of her like she is doing me a favor. This time she asked one time how I was feeling, but didn't care to ask if I needed anything. Last time I was sick, she didn't even ask once how I was feeling. I went to the store to buy food and was cooking for myself with fewer and she didn't offer to help. I deeply hate her. It didn't happen often to me, when I had zero sympathy to a person, and hated from the bottom of my heart, like I hate her. We live together for 6 months and 95% of the time I regret the decision that I moved in with her. Laying in bed, lonely and sick, makes me wish to just have a turn off button, to fall asleep and never wake up to this bullshit again.@@3
529@@ i'm 18 years old and I've been bored my entire life, playing videogames, wasting time on the internet and listening to music are 99% of the things i do when i have free time. Going out with the very few ""friends"" i have left in this depression trip doesn't really make me happy either unless i get really drunk, but that still makes me feel miserable in the end anyways. A month ago i even got in touch with a girl via a friend online, she told me i was pretty and all of that good shit and it made me kinda happy, it's easy to text a "":)"" or write ""hahaha"" but after agreeing to meet each other we said nearly nothing and both just sat there. i could just feel her disappointment in me and i wanted to die on the place, but i really don't blame her. i kinda knew this would happen but i followed everybodys genius tips ""put your bad mood aside and go for it man"", if only it was this simple to just put it away. anyways, i told her i'm depressed the day after that and that it's for her best we don't see each other again because i'll only bring her negativity and sadness. She asked if i needed her help but i didn't really know what to say to that, i wish i could be helped... well, a week ago i saw on her facebook shes seeing another guy and they seemed happy,  it made me shed a little tear, i wish i could be the guy to make her smile, but shes better off without me. i don't think i can ever fix this, i've lost nearly all my friends and making new just doesn't work out anymore, my motivation is gone and i can't remember the last time i truly enjoyed myself. And meanwhile i'm just sitting at home doing the same thing over and over and over again, everything has lost it's fun and i just want an end to this boring existence of me. The worst part is, i know tons of people that do no more than i do, but they just are okay and happy with their lives, and when we went out together they kept talking about it like they had the best time of their lives and meanwhile i was always like ""meh"". All of this is just in my head, but i can't get it out.@@4
530@@ I feel like my entire life is just some sick cycle of being sad, then really sad, then suicidal, than back to sad, etc. It never ends. I'm scared it never will end. I feel like no one understands me. I feel alone. I just want to be happy but I don't know what else I can do to make that happen.@@4
531@@ Basicay I have no friends or anyone who cares about me in real life. The people in my area are very stuck up, ignorant, narrow minded, etc. and don't accept me. Even if they did I have nothing in common with them anyways. The only social interaction I get is from people on the internet. Other than that I have no person in real life who cares about me. All I do is try to hope for the future and pass the time with things like the Internet, music, video games. I'm really getting sick of this routine. I lack any excitement or purpose in my life. Moreso I'm sick of the lack of anyone in my life and always being alone every day. However I have absolutely no idea how to change this. I consider myself a good person unlike most people and have always been helping others in need and caring for them. I don't deserve this. It's not fair. I deserve to be loved and accepted just like everyone else. I deserve what other people have. I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to kill myself but if there is nothing that will change then I might have no other choice. I just can't do this anymore. I've suffered long enough. If you don't know already I'm a 19 year old male about to turn 20 this next month and of course no one will be there on my birthday or care because I have no one. It hurts so much... It hurts so much to know that nobody cares about you. That you are alone in this existence. To know that you will die alone and there is nothing ahead@@2
532@@ I should just accept that I will always feel this way. I use to tell myself the problem with depression is it makes you feel like you'll be this way forever even though you won't. That was over 10 years ago. I guess I was wrong. All these years later, I still feel like this. I don't see the use in continuing to do this to myself. I won't get better. If I'm lucky I'll find new ways to cope. but at this point I'm not sure it's worth the effort.@@3
533@@ since my attempt this past september i have been putting on a brave face for everyone including myself. i've told friends/family/counselors that i want to get back on track with my life and i do but no matter what or how hard i try i can only think of trying again. i want so badly to feel normal again. not what everyone else sees as normal but back to what feels like normal me. i want to feel like myself again, but i dont now how to get there.@@3
534@@ I've been really struggling to fight against my suicidal thoughts these past couple months but I can't really see the point anymore. My life just isn't worth living: I'm not a very good or interesting person, socially I'm pretty much invisible, I can't get a job, my grades in uni are dropping and I'm in love with my best friend. Why bother fighting to keep that? I think the only reason I've stayed alive are an existential fear of being dead and the knowledge that my suicide would really harm the few people that care about me. I guess what I wish is that I could just cease to exist and wake up tomorrow as an entirely different person but, with that being impossible, suicide seems to be the only logical conclusion to this right now...@@3

537@@ On the surface, I am happy and caring. Deep down I am bitter, jealous, and materialistic. Ever since I was in high school, I have been a shoplifter. I was caught when I was in high school but since I was under age I wasn't punished. Then I got caught again two years ago and was giving alternative measure instead of criminal record. A normal person would regret and change. However, I kept doing the bad habit thinking this way I could save more money so that I could get a car and pay off my loans faster. I always think the world owns me since it gave me a terrible childhood, no friends, and no parents. I think that's why I steal like everything's mine. Of course, I got caught again. This time the police told me I don't deserve any more chances and that I am a criminal. I am a criminal all along. I feel so scared. I was planning to go to college in September but now with a criminal record I couldn't. There is no future for me. I have never been genuinely happy. Now it is over. in a sense, I feel relived that it is no longer a secret although I am terrified to have anyone I know find out the truth. i quit my jobs and rented a room so i can die with no interruption. I have been doing nothing for 4 days waiting to move in the new apartment. It is so quiet. My mind is going crazy with all sorts of thoughts. No one calls me. How I wish anyone would call and ask how am I doing. I told my current landlord that I am going on a vacation when in fact I am leaving the world. I suppose to go to the police station at some point to have my finger prints done. Hopefully someone will smell my body decay before then and report to the police. I don't want them to do a search warrant at my old landlord's place or at work. Yes, I am scared. But I cannot live a life not be able to go to school, not be able to look to the people I know in the eyes, and not be able to find a job. I am finished. I have giving chances but I never cared. I am so screwed up and ill natured. I hate myself so much. I hate myself.@@3
538@@ I think its time for me to die. The more i try the less i get. I juggle with my feelings so i wouldnt pass my feelings on other people that i know in person, i try so hard around them and what do i get from it? I get nothing absolutely nothing. Its not that i am trying to be nice to them so they would be nice to me, i am doing it coz thats me, i like helping, i like talking i like being with people. Why is it so hard to get that from other person? Why is it so god damn hard to care about someone? Why is it hard to care? I do my best, i really do, but i am alone. And even people that i consider my friends dont think of me to be that. I give my all to everyone i care about and they cant find enough decency in themselves to say simple fucking ""hi"" to me. Am i really that bad? And on top of it, that person who didnt even said ""hi"" to me today, person who i consider my ""bestie"" fucking said that i am the one who doesnt care! I am just hurt, i really am. On top of it we had a lesson today about enjoying life, how we should love our parents despite everything. They fucking beat me and hurt me, i have nightmares from them. They are ruining my every aspect of life every day. ANd i realized one thing, no matter how everyone treated me, i am the one to blame for it. I allowed it and i am allowing myself to suffer from it. I am my own enemy. I want to die so bad, and now the holiday season started, its the time i will spend fully alone, coz no one cares about me. I want to die so badly, since my life wont get better@@4
539@@ When will people learn that words cut like knifes. My husband that I am unhappily married too just said some bs before he left the house to run an errand. I asked a question and he jumped down my throat. I have told him my depression is very very bad pls try to de stress and not give me conflict. nope gotta yell at me for asking something he didn't have the answer too. he should wise up that, that could be his last conversation with me one day soon.@@3
540@@ I've already lost my faith and hope; now I'm about to lose my job, my home, custody of my child, and my girlfriend. I used to care; now I hardly do. This Prozac and Olanzapine makes me feel flat and endlessly bored. Exercise, books, music, movies, they used to give comfort; now everything seems tainted and trite. The prescriptions are new, but the depression and anxiety is not. So many youthful years have been languished away, and the future appears no brighter. Time drones on, yet slips away so quickly. I curse the past, forsake the present, and fear the future, but I have no regrets. So much double mindedness. So much sadness.@@5
541@@ Tired of being a guinea pig, tired of being poked and prodded, tired of adverse side effects, tired of my concerns/complaints being dismissed, tired of experiencing withdrawl like a fucking drug addict.  I just want it all to end and now......  But I have to wait and suffer till I get my affairs in order.  This illness has taken my life away, I had a shot at a decent life once.  But my own stupidity and this illness completely destroyed that.  Why?  Why do we have to suffer?  What is the point?  Fuck this, I plan on leaving before things get worse.@@3
542@@ Last night I had a dream that I was killed. When I was dead I was a ghost and was wandering around alongside my family. They couldn't see me and everyone looked so sad. It didn't bother me that much until I saw my brother. He's my best friend in the whole world. And he looked so broken in my dream. It hurt me deep down because I was hurting my family so much by being dead. Then I said that I needed to go back so I did. Instantly my family cheered up. I woke up crying immediately after that. This is the second dream I've had where I died.  (Recently) And I've been contemplating suicide everyday for a while now. Does anyone agree that these two things could possibly be connected? Though I want to die it makes me incredibly sad to hurt my family.@@2
543@@ Why should I wake up tomorrow? I'm trapped in my mind within the tiny island I live in and like in the song ""Cold"" by At The Gates the will to rise above is tearing my insides out. Jimi Hendrix describes it well too. I know what I want But I just don't know, honey How to go about getting it What are friends? I have none they are all just trying to be on top of each other like slime. What is life but survival? Everyone's out looking for their own. I feel like I'm just sitting on a cosmic merry go 'round. Did I break something in my brain? Ontop of all this my brother was killed this year 7 months ago and today would've been his birthday.. I was studying Psychology but i switched university and now I'm studying chemistry, basically to start all over again after all the credits i had in psychology, anyhow both of these interest me but in university they bore me... I need to feel more involved into what I want to do. Not just go to class write down notes, come home study and do homework and repeat. But I cant find the way.. I am desperate and anxious i cant contain it any more. The only person i talk to is my parents and mostly myself during the entire day. My dad knows how I feel but doesnt know how to help me. I don't like going to psychologists, I question my purpose in that chair during the interviews. I fear that one of these days I might erupt as my tears have. What can i do but post here, jack off and go to sleep to wake up with the same thoughts tomorrow. I'm very tired.@@4
544@@ I don't recall posting in this thread. However, I just can't bare what's happening in my life & with my health. I see that exiting this pathetic exsistance is the only way out of (all) the pains & suffering that I endure. I however, am UNABLE to do that. However, I'm tired of being the ""trash"" that exsists within a world of people, that are constantly treating me like it. I can't take this life of mine, but I want, so deeply for this painful existance to subside;once & for all. There's no denying myself, any more, for longing to exit this painful life I've, not only endured, but continue to be plagued with so many things. It's always bad news that I recieve & it just is becoming too overwhelming for myself to want to endure anything more. I'm tired of posting on here, about things never getting better. I'm tired of posting how pathetic my life is, knowing full well, other's have it (much) worse than myself. Right now, honestly, I don't care how poorly someone else has it, as I can't get past this feeling of hurting, so very deeply, & knowing how useless of a human being I truly am. It's an agonizing feeling, to know that people have nothing but unkind things to say, not only behind your back, but to your face. I'm done with watching other people enjoy life, while I constantly struggle to survive it. There's nothing that I have, that makes me 'want' to stay/stick around for the ""other shoe"" dropping. I'm plagued by mean, spiteful, & hurtful people that just verbally attack me, unprovoked, or just treat me like I don't even exsist any more. I'm tired of people saying that ""they never said that"" to me, when I dang well know, I haven't (completely) lost ""all my cookies"" yet. I hurt, so very badly, on a physical & emotional level, that it's just not tolerate the pains any longer. I long to find the peace in life, that I've never had & I never seem to ""find"" it's existance. People are so unkind, mean, spiteful, uncaring, & I could keep going with things. I'm not a perfect human, as I will openly/honestly admit to everyone/anyone. However, I'm still ""kicked"" by so many people, I can't handle the bruises/scars any longer. I don't wan to keep moving foward, when I see that there's nothing to move foward too. I've done my best to help other's & for that, my return is being further 'slammed to the ground.' It's become, too difficult, for myself to continue to hear, how much of a decline my health is & the year's being ""removed"" from the life I have. I'm depleated with being positive any more. I'm tired of ""the con game"" I play with myself, just to believe/think that things will change or that I will ""get the justice"" for the injustice done to myself/my life. It's crystal clear, that things will never change nor will I ""find"" that justice. I'm tired of people hurting me, distroying my life, & all the unkindness that people are capable of. It never stops & I believe, whole~heartedly that it never will. I'm tired of being bullied & never able to stand up to them or have some ""slick"" come backs, that would shut someone up, once & for all. It keeps coming at me, like a train that's lost it's breaks & is unable to stop. I'm exhusted with posting how things never change & how pathetic I am. All I used to be, all that I used to believe in, & all the hopes/dreams that I have had, have all been cut down, like cutting down a tree;that simple. There's no (real) treatment for what's happening to my health. I just sit & watch the signs of deterioration happening. I can't stop this nor can I do anything about it. It's just too much to ""carry the load"" of everything in my life. I have no friends, no family, & truly no one that cares about me. What's the point any more;truly? All I've become is a human punching bag for other's. All I get is nothing but more fustarations, pain, & more suffering. I guess, with my year's on this planet, I didn't have enough of this, from the very start of my life. What a horrible person I must (truly) be....@@3
545@@ I've spent the most part of my life wanting to commit suicide and wondering why I haven't done it yet. my whole life seems like a game to see how long I can cope and distract myself. first I tried school. I liked learning but I hated the environment. I don't think I need to say what goes on in grade school but kids aren't nice to loner kids like myself. I thought college might have decent people but it wasn't much different. people still feel the need to fuck with me on a daily basis. i dropped out of both high school and college. I also tried going to family for help but they don't give a shit. they seemed to care when my step dad took his drunken anger out on me but it turns out they only wanted to feel noble that they thought of it. i learned this when my uncle did the same thing, took his drunken anger out on me and they basically told me to suck it up. I would think myself ""yea I'll suck up that concussion thanks for the advice"". I moved to them to get away from my step dad but needless to say I packed my shit and moved again. now I'm lost trying to find distractions to justify my existence. after living for 21 years the best I've come up with are music, video games, or suicide. it's pathetic I know. I thought about taking antidepressants but I'm worried that I'll be faking happiness. sometimes Im so close to snapping and giving the people who made my life miserable what they deserve. other times I can barely gather the strength to stand.  how does a person live like this?@@5
546@@ Every day I read about or hear about people dying, murder, disease, and the people who are left behind grieving unthinkable loss. And then there's me who wishes I could die almost every day and I think why not me? Id trade places with them in a heartbeat. Why does the universe, god, whatever, whoever, take people who are loved and needed and leave people who are alone and ignored and shunned to suffer.@@4
547@@ It has now been 5 years since my first suicidal thought. I have  gone through all of high school sleep deprived and alone, not telling  anyone about my feelings or thoughts and putting on a performance for  everyone. I started smoking weed at the beginning of my senior year.  Usually that would involve going out and acting like an idiotic  teenager, but in my case it was sitting in a room playing video games  and listening to disorienting music. Every time. I started  college, still acting and faking, trying to be normal and inspired. I  wanted to be a normal person. I wanted to be something more. I had heard  all of these stories, thousands upon thousands of stories of people  being in funks during a select portion of their lives and then snapping  out. I knew I couldn't possibly stay like this forever. I would just  ignore it. I continued smoking every day, staying up until 4 or 5  in the morning every night. I stopped watching good movies and writing  creatively, and started watching trashy shit and writing sentence long  youtube comments. I began dating my girlfriend halfway through  my freshman year. She is a product of my diseased brain's desperate need  for sex and human contact. I picked the easiest target and went all  out, desperate to get this one win after my stale, uneventful high  school career. I was the stereotypical horny, basement dwelling piece  of shit, and I saw sex as the  next step in developing as a human. I quickly learned that sex was not  special at all. The term ""virginity"" was simply an idiotic term coined  by those who never realized this simple fact. I'm currently at  the point where I don't know what's true about my life. I don't know  what I've done simply out of my desperate need to cling to life. I'm a  film major, a useless major used by those content to be building blocks  for bigger things, since I thought it would help me start putting my  ""creative mind"" (the one thing I've ever been praised for) to work. There  is passion in my life. Only desire. I walk through the motions of  everyday existence as a stubborn corpse. A collage of the few  performances I've given that actually seemed to work with people. I  don't know why I bother writing about these pointless feelings I have  any more. People usually don't respond to these sorts of things. This  entire post is, after all, a desperate whimper for some sort of  salvation. Something to happen that will allow me to see why life in  front of me is beautiful. It has now been 5 years since my first suicidal thought, and I am getting worse.@@4
548@@ I attempted suicide twice in the last year, with resulting brain damage and major personality changes. I have tried for several months to rebuild my life, but the last few weeks I have spiralled down into a deep deep depression and think about ending my life almost constantly. I have lost all interest in pleasurable activities, am doing very little work in my job as a sales rep. I have become very emotionally distant from my long term partner who has stood by me through my suicide attempts and a period of hospitalisation. I cannot see any light at the end of the tunnel. Most worrying of all I have horrible unwanted violent thoughts I cannot shut off. I don't think I would ever act on them but nevertheless they make me feel like an evil twisted person and reinforce my belief that the world would be better off without me. My previous attempts were impulsive though serious and I am convinced I am going to snap again sometime soon. I hate myself and all I have become. I am confused, scared and tired of the torment my mind is putting me through.@@4
549@@ I'm lying in mine and fiancÃ©'s spare room thinking about how to kill myself while he lies downstairs and probably thinks about how to tell me he's not going to be able to go through with our wedding in just under three weeks. I've been doing things at night, to help me sleep. My fiancÃ© has no idea. This has been going on for the last few weeks since he confronted me with texts from a man who I found online and met to engage in oral sex for money. I done this in January and at the time I was having flashbacks, nightmares and panic attacks because of my rape at 12 years of age. Up until then I had never coped with it. I told my fiancÃ© about this for the first time. I wanted to try and explain why I'm so f*cked up in the head. I feel all I'm good for is sex. We talked through this and he agreed that he would work on things if I got help. I have since spoken to Rape Crisis and am planning on going to their centre to speak face to face with a counsellor. I also placed ads on Craigslist for worn panties (I never provided these) and responded to a couple looking for a female for a three some (I never followed through with this). He just found out about this yesterday and confronted me. Naturally he doesn't believe me when I tell him these things never happened. He is also angry that I never fessed up when he found out about this man a few weeks ago. I spent all day yesterday thinking about the best way to kill myself. I have no way to do this discreetly and no things to use in my house. I've self-harmed (having some body issues right now). I just can't bear to think of my family's pain when I'm dead. I tried the samaritans but I couldn't get the words out. If I go to A&E will they help me? I feel like a timewaster and a drama queen. It's all my own fault I feel like this. But I don't recognise the person I was in January and I want the old me back. I just want to marry my fiancÃ© and be a good wife to him. Please help@@5
550@@ My life is finally going good. I'm going to school for something I love, and I'm actually understanding it and passing. I'm getting a new car in the next couple months. My daughter has started school and she likes it. I'm finally getting divorced (in this case is a good thing). I've been trying for 6 years to get divorced. It took me the last 5 years to get over her....but...now that i'm over here there is this void where I used to obsess. I wanted her to come back. I had that desire...now that its gone I feel empty. I don't know what do do with myself. Whenever things go good in my life something bad happens. I had the chance to get one of my dream cars...two weeks later it caught fire and burned up. Often times I find my self fantasizing about suicide. I don't want to kill myself. I'm not going to go harm myself yet my thoughts keep wandering and I keep imagining myself doing it. I don't want to die, I'm just bored. I've done it all. Been married, had a child, got divorced, owned my dream car. I can drink and smoke so...what's left? What more is there to do? I'm bored. Sometimes I find new things to do but I get bored quickly of them and end up being bored again. I'm tired of being bored. Tired of putting on this mask happiness and everything is happy go lucky. I don't know what to do. Something is going to give and that scared me because I don't know what it will be.  I'm afraid that one day I will succumb to the boredom and just cross that line.@@4
551@@ I cant work, I can't get my daughter into college because I aint got money, I can't provide for my family, I cant be around people, im never happy in fact im always on the edge, well ive had enough, im gonna jump off, I think this is the end for me.@@4
552@@ I'll make this easy and to the point. I've struggled all my life,  literally.  18 surgeries. Couldn't do anything I wanted because of it.  As an adult,  i seem to keep finding the most selfish girls alive.  I've lost my daughter to my first marriage. My girlfriend now has dumped me 3 times,  yesterday in fact.  And she always says I didn't do anything wrong.  The problem on my end is how much I'm in love with her.  She says she loves me but keeps doing this to me.  I've never had feelings like the ones I have for her.  So it's impossible to just let it go. Oh and I recently got fired,  and the reason?  It didn't fit the budget. So I've come to one conclusion.  I am nothing more than expendable.  I mean nothing and i have no importance to anyone.  Do you know what it feels like to be completely and totally unwanted?  Useless? Pathetic? I have no one in life to talk to,  and when I've tried no one understands. So I ask here,  what in the world is the point anymore.  And no god is not the answer.  I go to sleep every night crying and wake up and soon after I'm crying again.  I can't do this anymore. The pain is too much and is intolerable.  I'm seeing no reason to continue trying.  The harder I try,  the more I get pushed away.@@5
553@@ Okay so what I'm going to tell you is true. Basically this has been what it's like for me. I think about suicide every single day for years. I have been bullied and excluded pretty much all my life and people have made many racial remarks against me for a long time. Nobody ever likes me or wants anything to do with me. It's gotten so bad now that I can't even go outside anymore. When I do I feel terrible. I just feel like killing myself right there. I see everyone with happy lives, good looking, with friends, in relationships, with so many great life experiences meanwhile I'm here 19 year old guy, still a virgin, all my memories were just being bullied and sitting at home with a bad family. The reason I never went out and did things like normal people is because I grew up in a culturally backwards family who didn't allow me. Because of this I have no life experiences and don't fit in anywhere. Nobody cares about me. All the girls I like would never want me and I can not even describe in words how bad it feels to know that nobody loves you. A while ago I had planned to end my life because it's too much, but I was too afraid to go through with it. I underestimated how hard it is. I just can't be alone anymore and a freak. I just can't be a loser anymore. I just can't be an outsider when everyone else is enjoying life anymore. What do I do?    :(@@3
554@@ Hello~ I am having a hard night. I drink too much and the nights can be very difficult. Sometimes I just feel like there is no hope for me. I am sad & scared and don't know what to do. I am trying to get help for my alcohol addiction but I am still in the early stages of treatment and it is difficult to see a way out. I have a plan for suicide but have don't really have a date, however I have tied up all loose ends so I am ready to do. The only thing holding me back is my family and God. I really don't know how much more I can take. As embarrassing and shameful as it is to admit, I am on my 3rd bottle of wine tonight.  I don't deserve to live. I don't deserve life. I am so stupid for letting this get out of control. I can't even stand myself. Please, I am asking for you to please pray or hope that I have the strength to end it. I can't take anymore. Thank You.@@4
555@@ I don't feel like bothering anymore. I'm just a burden. I have no plans but I just feel awful.@@1
556@@ So I'd planned my suicide date and I'd got my method sorted out and planned down to the last T. However I came home from school one day and my mum had been in my room she'd taken all the items I needed aswell as my lighters luckily she didn't find something else. Last time I tried to commit somehow my school found out and I ended up in hospital so it was a complete failed attempt I felt like this time was going to be right but then my mum just took the whole opportunity away from me. I don't know why though because I have nothing to live for and no one would even notice that I wasn't here any longer and it's just prolonging my misery I hate her for doing this.@@3
557@@ I never thought that suicide would be the easy way out and I don't think you can quite comprehend the bitter loneliness of that limbo between life and death until you have ""lived"" it.  All I remember that day is the numbness.  The pain I had been feeling for years had escalated to the point to where I just didn't feel it anymore.  I got up, took a shower, drove to 3 different stores so it wouldn't be obvious.  I maxed my credit card out buying what I thought would be the last purchases of my life.  I don't think I believed that I would do it, until I was sitting there on my bed.  I had decided that I really just couldn't take it anymore.  I don't care who you talk to or what they say, but no one truly wants to die.  I laid down on my pillow and closed my eyes waiting to fall asleep.  And as I laid there I began to cry.  The finality of what I was doing hit me so hard.  I wasn't just ending my life, I was ending my very existence and I felt panic and I felt ashamed.  I mean how weak am I that I couldn't even handle just living my life anymore.  I had become so weak, I had just given up. Obviously I didn't die because I am sitting here at this very moment, all these years later, writing about something so taboo in my life and yet I still want to die.  If god would take me, i would willingly go with him, and these are hard thoughts and feelings to have on a daily basis.  So for anyone who wants to spout that people who commit suicide are selfish, I would like to say fuck you!  How would you like to live in horrible pain and anguish everyday, feeling like you're a mistake of life, and that the world would be better off if you were dead?  But I suppose we're suppose to endure it so loved ones won't be sad or hurt.  Well okay, I'll suffer for the next 50 years, sinking deeper and deeper until I am actually one with the scum of the earth and you can go on and live your happy life and be content because you can still be in my company. How is that not fucking selfish?! *guess I am having a hard time tonight and these are just my thoughts for this moment, I hope I didn't offend anyone.@@2
558@@ i feel old and ugly.. i got hurt so many times... no one likes me anymore because i have no light shininhg witin me... im broken and im olde smd ugly... i drank tonight cus i hate myself. i drank to take the pain away. wish i coulsd kill mysel im just a pievce of shit, i dont matter... im nthing... nothing AT all@@4
559@@ As i write this, i am in my school (uni) , so many rude sarcastic comments about me, so much ignorance, some people that i know and deeply care about didnt even bother saying hi to me, including my crush ( she is mad at me last 2 days). 3 girls just went honestly and cruely offending me with some sarcastic jokes and all. I just came from uni wc where i cutted, no one even noticed, no one wont notice. Why? Its coz i am unimportant, no one ever cared, no one ever will. All i think about now is just simply going back to wc and ending it once and for all... I can bet no one will notice if that happens.@@5
560@@ I hate it when people say this is not forever or it will get better. Well it hasn't!! I wish I did not have people in my life that would give a shit if completed suicide. I want to leave this world so badly. I cannot stand my chronic disorders anymore. They are debilitating and I just do not see joy that can come from even managing them. There is no cure for what I have and it is so awful. I sincerely want to die.@@4
561@@ Yah I think I do need to talk about how I am feeling. I haven't been able to really tell anyone about it, or at least how I truly feel. I think about suicide every day. My mom killed her self when I was ten years old and my father left me right when I was born. Everyone that knows me and knows my life has said they don't know anyone else who has had a harder life than me. I am 24 now and lived a life of constant drug abuse for ten years following my moms death. So when I was 20 I got sober and for a while life seemed to get better but this past year has just been the worst. I mean even though I am doing positive things with my life I feel like the time I spend thinking about suicide just keeps increasing. Some days I estimate I spend 4 plus hours a day thinking about it. It has become almost a fantasy and I imagine all the ways I could do it and think about every detail in the process. Its like a movie playing in my head on low volume all the time and I even imagine my suicide while listening to people talk and laughing and going about my normal day. If I were to look at my life on a written paper I wouldn't even believe a person could go on living like this. But something deep down inside me keeps me alive somehow. No matter how much time I spend contemplating suicide I have always known that I couldn't do it. I think this is partly because my mom did it and I saw how bad it hurt everyone around her and that is what stops me. Its like a deep down subconscious knowing that just KNOWS I am not going to do it and I have had it my whole life. Lately though I have noticed myself distancing myself from my close loved ones and I am starting to wonder if this means I might actually do it. Anyway I have these blocks that don't allow me to appear weak to people so no one really knows this is going on. I thought I wasn't ever going to tell anyone but then it hit me that I could just do it anonymously on a forum and maybe it might help. So here is my attempt to to express myself and see if it helps. Thanks for listening.@@3
562@@ I miss my staff like crazy. Ones I ended up in jail over.@@4
563@@ I just don't know what to do anymore. Death is the only solution. I don't know what to do about anything. I don't have the will to continue. There is no point. There never was. My mind is suffocating me to death on a daily basis. It won't allow me to do anything. I am killing myself from the inside and nobody on the outside knows just how severe it is. It's not their fault. It's not my fault. It's just that I was made to suffer. I'm powerless. I just want to get away from my existence. But then it'll be the same shit. I deathly need to get mental help and get help for my unbearable physical pain. My mind won't let me. It refuses. It's like a parasite... my logic has concluded that death is the only option and I just can't argue about it with myself anymore. Nobody can take the steps for me to fight for my life. I need to have the will and motivation to continue and I just don't have it. I don't. I'm defeated. I know in my heart that the end is coming for me soon. It's gonna be painful. I fear everything... I'm helpless. Weak. Useless. Just a leech at this point. I can't wait for all the fear to go away. It's all gonna come crashing down. I hate myself and I hate existence. What a cruel joke. I don't know why I'm even reaching out anymore. This is not goodbye. That's all I got right now. All I got left.@@3
564@@ I'd like to begin by saying that yes, I do realize that my problems pale in comparison to most others in my situation and no, I do not have a valid reason to kill myself and I'm a little shit for contemplating it. But quite frankly...I don't care. I don't feel as if I need such a justification. Anyways, on to the story. As the title states I am 15 years old. I suppose you could say that the depression and occasional numbness I get that I hide on a daily basis stems from my parents and a general love/hate sorta relationship with life, along with plain old boredom. As for my parents, well...it's possible that they do mean well but they are quite simply terrible, terrible parents. Upon realizing that I self-harm and so does my best friend, they promptly take my cell phone, force me to cut all contact with  that person, and completely isolate me from each and every one of my friends. No going out, no talking to people, no Skype, no playing video games with anyone. They've always been very anti-friends for whatever reason and prior to finding out about that I am a cutter they already greatly restricted my access to such things. This just makes me feel absolutely terrible since I end up being constantly alone and having to turn down invites to hanging out and such. I'd usually cut and end up crying myself to sleep when that happened. But I could deal with all that, since I had my best friend. She made everything better. She'd go through tough times herself too, and we'd be able to solve things together. I love her. In fact, I in love with her too and she had feelings for me as well at some point but that's another story. After my parents took my phone, we could no longer talk every day and I had to resort to using Skype IM to contact her. The worst part was that we had both agreed to stop cutting before that happened and everything would have been okay. Ever since then we've been talking less and less and I feel ourselves drifting away. She is (or perhaps was) the only person who truly cared about me and loved me for who I am in the entire world. The only one who would genuinely feel bad if I killed myself. And now, these past few weeks or so we've barely talked at all and each time I think about that and how things were between us before I just want to die. She's found other people now, I guess. After my parents found out that I wanted to kill myself after reading through my messages between me and her after promising not to (the ultimate invasion of privacy) they said some pretty mean stuff (they're always mean, yelling and name-calling and such. Nothing is ever good enough.) including telling me to ""just kill myself already"" and calling me a ""psycho"" for cutting, etc. They also said some horrible fucking things about my best friend that made me question their sanity including ""I hope she cuts too deep next time and kills herself"". It's gotten to the point where I dread coming home after school because I know I'll end up feeling really bad and crying. Weekends are especially bad since I'm locked at home with nothing to do, no one to talk to. I used to love weekends. Anyways...besides all that stuff there's also the fact that I'm a junior in high school at 15 years of age and I've had my childhood and teenage years robbed from me by my parents. I was forced to skip a grade at a younger age for reasons unknown and my parents forcibly enrolled me part time at my local state university this year. I'm already enrolled full time next year, meaning I'll be 16 and in college with absolute strangers who are all years and years older than me. Whenever I go there now for part time enrollment I end up going to class and then sitting down somewhere and just being sad until my parents drive over and pick me up (fashionably late of course, they usually wait 2-4 hours before picking me up after class ends and they refuse to allow me to even get a permit for driving until I turn 18). Is it too much to want to finish my 12th year of high school as a normal fucking person? Why is it never enough for them, no matter what I do? There's no end to this bullshit, there's no way I can live for another 3 years under their legal control feeling this way. I think that's enough on my parents. As for the rest, well...I'm just bored with what life has to offer so far. I'm one of those persons who love to go on adventures and do crazy, dangerous, and life-threatening shit with friends although I never quite get the opportunity to do any of that stuff due to my parents. I have no fear of death whatsoever, quite the opposite in fact. I welcome the idea of death. I keep hoping I'll get in an accident so I won't have to do it myself. I know I'll get to do a lot of that stuff later in life if I so choose but it all seems too far away and the path to that way of life is hard and paved with difficulties. I don't see how life is worth living. I have no more reasons left to live, my last reason died with my prior best friend's faded friendship. What's the point? Life's just gonna fuck us over in the end. I haven't even experienced anything worth killing myself over and yet I'm pretty set on doing it anyways. How am I going to deal with more serious problems in the future? The answer is simple to me. I won't. Not sure why I'm even posting this here, I guess I just want to talk to someone. Sorry if that all appears really disjointed, it's 3am and I can't sleep as always. Thanks for reading c:@@5
565@@ I want to die, but not suicidal. I just feel that dying is so much easier and better than living. Right now, I want to go to bed, and if I don't wake up (i.e., have a massive heart attack or whatever), I honestly would not care. If I wake up, it's another agonizing day. Ironically, life is a temporary death sentence for me. I'm just tired of trying to reach my goals, only to have them dashed because of other people. I just hate it. Is it confusing to actually want to die but not be suicidal? Basically, I feel that if someone broke into my house and threatened to kill me, I would honestly take it.@@3
566@@ but not really enthused with life. Don't even feel like writing this message so I'll keep it brief. Part of me just feels like there's nothing left for me to do.@@2
567@@ Hey guys, I am a 16 years old, I have been depressed for a very long time my issues vary from being insecure about my physical appearance to fearing my ability to do something would be lost, every time I feel down I contemplate suicide but don't have the guts to do it. Today is probably my worst, this is going to sound stupid but here goes... I am drawing a piece of art which is for my GCSE (a school qualification) when I started drawing this piece I felt as though my drawing skills were were really good as I took my time drawing every single detail, I was just so relaxed, but from yesterday I feel as though my ability to draw has been lost, I feel as though my drawing has not been accurate at all, all the energy has just been sucked out of me due to constant drawing as I'm under pressure to getting this done quick. I just feel so down right now suicide can only be the answer to stop me feeling the way I am feeling now, I am just so confused right now even my ability to grammatically explain my situation is lost, did that even make sense? pls help me@@4
568@@ I'm serious no attention seeking. Suicide is becoming a serious option for me. My problem is that I am totally alone and nobody cares about me. I feel really really sad right now. I am crying as I type this. I know nobody in real life so this website is the only place I can turn to. It is just so heartbreaking to see other people in love, having friends, people who care about them while nobody loves me :(. I am a racial minority where I live and that may have contributed to the reason I am isolated today. I do not like the people of my race. They are backwards, greedy, savage. I come from a culturally backwards eastern family and that may have been the reason I am like this today. I am a 20 year old guy. All I want is a woman to love, friends, just to have people who really care about me. I'm tired of being alone and suicidal every day. People don't accept me in the area that I live in. Maybe it's just the area? It could be different if I moved but I'm not sure. I have tried but people reject me here and are superficial. I just want to fit in western society and have people who really care about me and a lover :(. The good thing is I am well financially. I have A lot of money saved up and a good real estate business going. None of that means anything to me because life is pointless all alone. I just really really need help on what to do. I can't bear being alone anymore and want to be loved and accepted somewhere in western society. But I have no idea how to get those things. Please any advice and help would really really be appreciated. Thank you@@3
569@@ Things haven't getting better since I developed clinical depression. All I can think about is how much I hate myself and how great death must be. Killing myself really seems like my only hope of getting past this.@@2
570@@ I graduated college a few years ago. But long story short, I missed the boat as far as getting a career is concerned. As a result, my parents are still supporting me financially. Anyway, this feeling of being a financial burden on my family has given me suicidal thoughts. My parents do well for themselves financially and are totally able and willing to support me. But that's not the point. I still feel like a failure for depending on my parents at my age. And I doubt things will get better. The economic outlook isn't looking good for my generation. Some people call us the lost generation. My parents have worked hard their whole life. And now they're approaching retirement age. Even if they have the money to support me, they deserve better during their golden years. They deserve to spend their money on themselves. They deserve better than having to waste their money supporting their failure of a child. But however big of a financial burden I am on my parents, the emotional burden on my parents if I took my life would be way bigger. So it looks like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't. Whether I live or die, I'm going to be some type of burden on my parents. The only question is would I rather be a financial burden or an emotional burden. I'm not going to take my life in the immediate future. But I'm at a loss for what I should do.@@3
571@@ I don't seem to have any positive affect on anyone's life. There's people who care about me but all I do is make them worry and become unhappy. I know that even killing myself would just be another way i'd hurt them. I wish i could just disappear without anyone noticing. I could actually do that with my friends because I'm kinda forgettable and no one really starts conversations with me but my family would contact me eventually then everyone else would find out. It seems there's nothing I can do but hurt people so why do I even exist? My depression isn't going away and all I can think about is killing myself. I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore@@5
572@@ I wasn't sure where to turn to, so I googled forums and this one came up. So hello there. I just recently turned 28, I work full time have an amazing therapist, but no real fulfillment in my life. I was also diagnosed with a benign brain tumor last year and since then my quality of life has gone downhill fast. It's hard to keep up with my job as the medicine I take makes me sick, but if i don't take it, I'm just as sick and run the risk of the tumor getting larger. I'm sick all of the time, it gets so frustrating. Since I 'look' well, most people think I'm just whining all of the time. i know that I will never get better, so the idea of living with this sickness forever makes the future seem a bit dark and pointless, of course there is no one I can say that to. I don't have a family, I have a roommate and a couple of friends, and that's it, so I know I wouldn't be leaving too much behind. It's just scary, that my mind has gotten to be like this. I try every day to fight this, to hold on, I'm just getting so tired. Anyone else ever feel like this? Well wishes to all@@4
573@@ I havenâ€™t accomplished much. I canâ€™t maintain a platonic or romantic relationship because I am a psycho. I am too much for my family to handle.@@3
574@@ Note?  This will not happen too soon, but I was gonna leave one for my family and a different one for friends, cause they do not know that I am mentally ill.  Only my 5 childhood friends know that I have been suicidal in the past, but they never knew why, other than I felt my life sucked and I wanted out.  They do not know that I suffer from depression and schizophrenia or the terrible side effects of the meds that I endure. I am not quite sure what to say in it? (the one to my friends) Should I start at the beginning?  I guess that would be a good spot to begin,  I have been living with this for 13 years.  At least they will know that I fought and didnt just leave for no real reason at all.  I have even thought of asking them to do me one favor, carry my body to it's final resting place.  I do not like my mom's family, I do not want their filthy hands on my casket.  Hell I'd prefer them not be there at all.  But would it be selfish of me to ask them to do me that one favor?  I dont think I've ever asked them for anything or much in my life.  I hope it is something they would do for me. But to make things clear before I go this route I'm gonna make one last push to learn web design and pull my life together.  If the side effects grow worse or my condition worsens then I intend to put an end to everything.@@1
575@@ I am all alone. I don't have a single friend left. I long for human connection, it makes me so sad. I still feel pain from the past. When will my life change. I have nearly been out of work for three years. My story is too complicated to go in to now. My most recent suicide attempt was last year i n hospital I escaped the psyche ward and stood on the roof. I was sectioned for six months. I want to drink myself into oblivion. Despair, desolate. Empty. Insignificance. I wish I were someone else.@@2
576@@ I feel like I am wasting my time being alive. All this time, and it was for nothing, everything that ever happened to me was for nothing and lead to nothing. I didnâ€™t gain anything, and nothing has changed. Suicide seems closer and closer. I always knew that I would die by suicide. But it appears that it is closer now. It is sad, but there is no hope, all the damage has been done. I am 27 years old, have not finished college yet, donâ€™t have a job, donâ€™t have any friends and thus never really go out. When I do go out it is with my mom or by myself and it gets very lonely. I hate the way I look, I am ugly beyond your imagination. No girl has ever wanted to go out with me and I asked out a ton of girls before. Everyone always criticizes me, telling me â€œdo thisâ€ â€œdo thatâ€, I am just a piece of shit. The two true friends that I had, one left me and the other was a fake. I never had a true, loving friendship, it never existed for me, I don't know what that is like or how it feels. Everywhere I turn, everything is a mockery, a tease of what I will never have or be. All I get are judgments from everyone believing bad things about me, judging me; the loser that I am. Every day is full of rage, contempt, jealousy, hatred. My body is covered in scars now. Iâ€™m on meds and they help some but not enough. I see a therapist but it is not enough, I exercise but it is not enough. The trauma and the constant social ostracizing that I have gone through to this very day, it takes a toll on me. The damage has been done and I am already built. I donâ€™t care what happens tomorrow or next week or next month, I donâ€™t have any wonder for the future. I sometimes fantasize of a life where I am the best possible me, with friends and a girlfriend but it is just a fantasy world and has been since I was a teenager, all a bunch of lies. Every single day people see and I see what a piece of shit I am, every single day I get rejected and ignored. The fact is I will die by suicide. The question was always when. I perhaps should have done it by now, because like I said, I am wasting time. I am afraid that this is it, my death will come soon.@@5
577@@ :( I wish I wasn't trash, ugly, a loser, worthless, joke, iloser that nobody likes. I can't take it abymore it's not funny. It's too much for me. I just want to be a normal person that can be loved and not trash. Is that too much to ask for? Sometimes suicide seems like the answer but deep down I don't want to die and Im afraid to :( .@@4
578@@ Not sure if I will, but this is really just a waste. I contribute nothing. I have no life outside of work. My job is meaningless. If I was gone all that would happen is my employer would scramble for a few weeks to fill my position. Then the world would forget about me.@@4
579@@ I'm beginning to think that trying to not be depressed is a crock of shit. I'm pretty much giving up on even trying to smile because I know from two years of experience it'll just get ruined one minute or another. At least when I'm depressed I don't have to worry about it getting worse. And at least depression doesn't jump between itself and every other mood.@@3
580@@ I rarely talk to my family about my mental health. Hell, I rarely talk to them at all. It's been weeks since I heard any of their voices. I really only ever talk to my mom and dad. Our conversations are almost always superficial. It seems impossible to talk about real things in my family. This, the fact that I have no friends, and my lack of any mental health treatment means this forum is basically the only place for me to vent. I can't do this on my own anymore. I don't know what to say to them. While they offer support they never have anything substantive to say or give. I don't know how to bring up suicide around them in any way that would be productive. Most likely it would just make them worry and not lead to me getting any help at all.@@5
581@@ Not sure where to start.... I dropped out of high school my senior year due to depression and intrusive irrational thoughts. Three years later and i'm still the same person i've always been, i'm a short 5'6 male and a  failure. I used to believe that looks were all that mattered in life due to a halo effect which not only got you women but everyone else would want to be around you and perceive you in a certain light but now that has all changed. I now believe that all that matters in life is intelligence and obviously since I dropped out of high school to get my GED I've pieced together all of the statistics and have come to the conclusion that i'm a complete moron. I'll never be able to experience what it is to have a higher level of thinking, to be able to succeed in anything I want to do. Due to my most likely low IQ it seems that I am doomed to a life of complete and utter mediocrity and there's no way to change what genetics have given you. On top of all of this i'm lazy and my life seems to always race around in a circle. I know the saying ""the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" but I TRY to get out there and socialize.. Hell, i'm a cashier at a super busy store and talk to so many people a day but yet I still feel hate and anger towards myself. I'm 21 years old without even a lick of college and on top of that I've never had a girlfriend and i'm a complete pushover. I'm a decent looking guy but there's no way i'll ever end up with a woman i'm actually attracted to. This is something private but I even get off to the thought of a woman rejecting me because she isn't attracted to me because i'm to short and not good looking enough for her. I love the feeling of rejection and sadness because if it weren't for those things i'd feel nothing at all. I love nothing more than to listen to depressing music and reminisce on old memories and times when people have walked all over me and made me feel terrible. To the outside world I look like I have it all together... it's the perfect secret. I'm a good looking, ""charming"" guy with a bright future ahead of me, what could go wrong? I was even talking to this girl at work a couple of months ago and we started talking about stress, etc and I told her ""everyone has their problems"". She then replied ""but you're picture perfect!"". How wrong she was. Whenever i'm tired, everyone assumes I was probably out partying but the truth is I never party or drink.. I just truly can't sleep at night. I have no self confidence. I've been boiled all the way to my lowest point and have said nothing to the person that oppressed me. If I was to be rejected by a woman right now that would surely make me want to contemplate ending my life. I really don't know where to go from here, I've been in a struggling battle with myself for 5 years and now I have to see my brother take this really cute girl to prom... I never had a girl to take to prom as I was a 230 lb chubby guy and now i'm a 165 lb overweight guy(5'6). I'm a mixed Caucasian and Arabic kid and that just makes me feel as though I don't fit in to either category. I've never fit in with other kids and people have always found ways to take advantage of me once they find out how much of a people pleaser I truly am at heart. Now all I do is just sit at home watching youtube just seeing the time pass by and how much of my life and youth I've wasted. I'm a literal nut job and surely don't deserve the life I'm living but i'm too deep in myself to do anything about it... every  day gets worse and worse.@@4
582@@ Ive been depressed since high school. im now a junior in college. i feel like a failure. nothing i do ever turns out right. no matter how hard i try to do things right and get ahead its like the universe has to slap me back down. i think my parents are the main cause. theyre so controlling and overprotective and close minded. 1 example being, i had the most miserable high school experience. i wasnt allowed to do anything. i had my 1st kiss in 9th grade and what, i thought, was a momentous occasion in a young girls life my mother turned into the worst memory. i lost all privileges for all 4 years all due to 1 kiss. my mother still brings it up to embarrass me. anytime i had any kind of relationship with a boy i had to keep it a secret in fear of my parents finding out and today years later they still judge me from past mistakes. i look at my friends and long for the type of relationships they have with their parents. im 21 and they still continue to control my life. they are so non supportive and manipulating it drives me insane. i try so hard in school and i just dont have anything to show for it because when i try to get motivated my depression over powers it. im such a good person but i feel like i cant catch a break sometimes, im  a christian and pray heavily but its like everything i pray for, i get the opposite. i just hate waking up everyday knowing what i have to deal with, i cant see anything in the future to look forward to and feel so completely alone. i think of suicide often just because being at peace would be so much better than having to deal with being a failure. sometimes i just dont feel loved at all. tonight i looked up painless suicide methods. im trying to be strong but it gets harder and harder everyday.@@5
583@@ Been reading these forums off and on for a few months and finally decided to jpin in the discussion.  Where do I start.  I'm a 34 year old male, lifelong Floridian. Attempted suicide three times, with many other near attempts.  Nobody knows about any of the attempts except my psychiatrist.  One I was able to play of as an accident.  This was mostly when I was in the 17-25 age range before I sought out help.  I've suffered from and was finally diagnosed with major depression and anxiety about 9 years ago when I finally got professinal help.  The medications/treatment really did help but the anxiety is still there in a big way, even if reduced.  The major bouts of depression still come on several times a year, sometimes due to a particular event, sometimes not. I don't have a lot of friends or family to confide in due largely to my anti-social problems.  Really I only have one long-time friend and he moved to Ohio recently, which has triggered a major depression and some suicidal thoughts of late.  The slightest change in my life tends to trigger the dark side of me.  I'm straight but more along the lines of asexual due to my many 'issues,' never having had a relationship more than a couple months and no relationships for years at a time during some spells.  I'm now suffering from other health issues such as glaucoma and chronic back and wrist pain.  Due to the physical pain I'm now dependent if not addicted to Vicodin.  In total I'm now on 8 different prescription drugs.  While they may be overall helpful they still cause side effects taking so many things.  I'm just at wit's end and really see no positive long-term prospects for my life.  If I thought I'd be headed to a better place (I am an atheist and don't) I probably would have ended it by now.@@2
584@@ 22 yo college student. Title pretty much describes it in a nutshell. There is no love in my family, and I don't even want it anymore since they completely messed me up growing up---just want to get away. As an introvert I don't make close friends easily, and I don't get satisfaction from casual friends. My main focus has been on getting a romantic relationship, but the half dozen girls I have briefly dated in my four years of college all ended up dumping me. I was ready to give everything to them, and was so devoted. I would bike from my off-campus apartment at midnight just to go watch netflix with them, and would listen and console them when they were sad, and I would tell them how much I loved them regularly. But at the end of the day it doesn't matter how you feel about someone or what you are willing to do for them. What matters is who you are, and how they feel about you. And from experience, I have learned that I am not a person who can inspire love. I am not exciting enough, not funny enough, not outgoing enough. Being just emotional turns them off pretty fast, but I can't help it if that is how I feel. Right now I am having a bit of an episode, I guess, thinking about how I have failed to find love at college (the place where it should have been easiest), and how now I am going into the real world, alone, where it will be infinitely more difficult. I don't think there is any hope for me. My one dream my entire life has been to experience love, and now I don't believe it will ever happen to me.@@5
585@@ This world is a horrible place. Everyone should realize that objectively this world and humans are horrible. While some are suffering others live it up in luxury and there is no afterlife. This world is a joke. Every person in this planet is evil@@4
586@@ Hello I'm Quinn. I am thinking about suicide. I can't stop it I just want to end it all. Everything is bullshit recently and it's suffocating to endure. No one will answer my plea for help this is like my last shot. I can't take it anymore it's infuriating and so horrible. I'm not weak or selfish I've thought of everything but I'm convinced it's better without me. I'm getting bad again, and no one has noticed. I'm supposed to be better by now dammit music is the only escape I have left. Screaming lyrics barely keep me alive@@2
587@@ October 28th, 2014 was the last attempt i made. i posted here saying i had a notebook and that when it was full i would kill myself. well i filled it. i spent around 10pages doing letters then i used the rest to write ""im sorry"". I rummaged through my friends room for something I could use, found it, and couldnt do it. called the hotline, kept me safe. i promptly moved out. this was after i pretty much threw away a budding relationship. I have started to try and talk to her again, trying to get back what we had, but pretty much am back to square one. those closest to me i cant even trust anymore. anytime i vent out to them i get ""just be happy spencer, just gotta get through it"" and i have no support system anymore. I feel lost, and these thoughts wont stop anymore. i thought i was doing so much better but it feels like anything minor can set off a suicidal thought spree. im scared, guys.@@5
588@@ Hi all. First time posting here. I think the only thing stopping me from throwing in the towel are my niece and nephews. I don't want them to suffer from me not being around. I help a lot with the kids, both physically and emotionally and we love being around each other, so that seems to be the only thing holding me back. On the other hand, I'm so tired of thinking. I can't do this anymore. I wish there was a pill one could take to stop thinking altogether. There's only one way I can think of to stop thinking, and I'm well on my way to taking the leap. I've been thinking about all the different ways I can do it so that it has the less possible impact on my family. I can't live with the fact that people are fake and say things just for the sake of saying it. Recently I met this woman and got very interested in her. We started getting to know each other and eventually we were telling each other things and saying things to each other that people in relationships would say. Things like I miss you, you are special to me, we have a special bond, I love how you make me feel. Then out of the blue it stops. Now we are reduced down to 1 message a day if I'm lucky. I believe she said all of those things to get me to like her and when she realised I did like her and she was liking me just as much back, she cut it off. So I don't understand. Why say things to another human being and then stop saying them? It makes me feel like I've been played and I hate that because I don't do that. How can someone do that? I've lost all hope in humanity. The only way I can think of to not trust anyone again is to just not be around for it to happen. So for now I'll keep thinking of ways to do it. I've tried a few things before, obviously it never worked. My ex-girlfriend used to make fun of me for trying to end my life and not succeeding. I just can't do this anymore. Thanks for reading if you did@@4
589@@ I have thought about it for quite a while. My life is not what I want to live. The things I want in life (not material at all) are not possible for me the have anymore and my situation is in a downward spiral. I cant change it. Nothing I do will make a difference at this point. I am not depressed. I have seen counselors and none of them put me on meds at all. They say its just a bad situation and circumstances. Well, they aren't going to change and I refuse to live in a state of mere survival. I'm a giver, and with nothing to offer or give, I am dead already. I have decided to end my life and have thought a lot about how I will do it. I am not depressed. I am just at the end of the road. I have lived my life. I don't want to live the rest of my life suffering. It's time for me to go.@@5
590@@ This is how things have been for me for years. Pretty much my school career I was ignored daily and just the guy nobody cared about. It was pure torture just being there every day looking at how great everyone else has it while I was all alone and knowing I will die alone and nobody will care. It's horrible. Nothing can describe how bad it feels to be all alone and know that nobody cares about or loves you. To know that you will die alone. I don't know what to do anymore I really need advice, right now I have no social life and no person cares about me. I spend every day in college alone while watching other people have great lives full of love, excitement, care, fun it's just pure torture. This is how things have always been for me. Every day I am closer and closer to suicide and I know that even if I did that nobody would care. I just am running out of options now and need any advice. I'm going to lose it soon. I just can't do this anymore. I need someone, anyone to just talk to me, tell me something, anything@@3
591@@ I don't even know what to type here other than I finally feel like I have no where else to turn.  I see nothing left for me in this life, I just want to die.  I struggled with addiction for over 10 years.  I finally got clean and have almost 6 months.  I thought things would get better but they haven't. I wish I would have been left to die so many times but I always got saved.  Please help me I want to die.  I don't even have the energy to call a hotline.  It would be so much easier if i could just get this pain to go away@@4
592@@ Everyday I have a suicidal thought. I know I will never act on it but I always think about it. The fear of hurting my family is what stops me. But I feel like everything has drained out of me. No job no friends nothing..I feel like I'll never get that big break. My nephew just turned one two months ago. I fear that as he gets older hes going to always see his lame pathetic loser uncle still living in his grandmas house. That makes me feel ashamed of myself. Maybe I'm not trying hard enough but I feel so damn weak to make that big of an effort. It seems so hard of a task to get out there and really apply myself. I rather just live in a different world where I don't have to worry about surviving. I feel like I'm living in the grey. I feel like I'm not worth living..I feel like curling up everynight in my bed. Sometimes I feel like I want to sleep during the day. I've tried therapy in the past and seeing a psychiatrist but making the appointments and having the sessions were stressful I felt better staying home. But it's killing me. I miss working and I don't miss working. I just want to be comfortable and know that I will surive.@@4
593@@ My life have been better and worse, right now I'm just so fed up. I looked at my old university photos and they were so wonderful, I was happy. Now I live with my parents as I'm told to, work a job I dislike because I'm told to, literally watching life passes through me. I have no goals, no dreams, living my life like a dead person. The only thing I hope for is that one day I will be free, to go wherever I want and do whatever makes me happy (within reasons) , but that day, is so far away, I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. How do I carry on? I can't. I'm so fed up with my life. I've been on help and depression forum for 10 years, I've read all the advice that was available, I've been told to open up, make changes, been told it's up to me, been told no one else can do it for me, been told that it is up to me to speak up, literally been told everything that I have heard of, but I can't try anymore, I can't do it when I'm chained up, physically(metaphorically) and emotionally. Just can't anymore.@@2
594@@ There are 7 billion people in this world. Losing one won't mean a thing. I'm sick of struggling, being rejected, left out, ignored, and forgotten. I'm stuck with a dead end life. I can never accept myself no matter how hard I try. I fail at everything I try. My existence means nothing. If I were to disappear tomorrow, no one would notice or care. Really, if Robin Williams couldn't make it through, what chance do I have?@@4
595@@ Pretty much it; just waiting for 'the day' to work up the courage. Waking up everyday is pure torture.@@2
596@@ Hi everyone! Ok. I know there have been probably a ton of posts like mine, but I just want to share my thoughts and maybe someone can say something, anything that can help me. This is my first time on any of the forums like this. I'm at the point where I can't take life as it is anymore, and I'm not even on PMS. I'm 35, and if you see me on the street, you will probably think - that's a pretty, fashionable, confident, fit woman. I have been told that I am very good-looking, I take good care of my body, I workout regularly, some say I have a body of 25 year old, I don't look anything near 35, I know fashion, I dress always nicely, I am witty, try to be funny, I am well-mannered and educated, although right now I have problems with my job. Now the negatives - my dad hanged himself when I was 16 after losing all our money in casino, I have been a main provider for my mom and me since then, when my mom was very depressed, she was dating numerous alcoholics and finally had cancer, so I watched her die slowly and in horrible pain and torture, I was the only one taking care for her, there was no palliative care. At that time I was married, my now ex-husband was not 100% supportive, I tried to be a good wife, but after my mom died I went into depression and our marriage fell apart. My ex and me moved into a new city before divorce, I got my life here but not many friends, in fact very few. I'm an introvert and it's hard for me to make lots of friends. After divorce I started dating and had 2 relationships, the last one when my boyfriend disappeared after a fight and doesn't return my txts (I am not bombarding him with txts or calls or stalking him, but I am nicely trying to find out why and what happened). I have connected with him and we made plans for the future, including business and marriage, and now everything is crushed. This has been very hard on me because I really cared for him, but I found out he was lying to me and confronted him (it wasn't about another woman or anything like that), after that we had an argument, he never admitted to his lies and just stopped all communication with me. I know this took a toll on me really badly. But in reality I do not see any purpose in living. Im tired of making friendships that do not last, trying to date men that do not last, I have no family, my job is falling apart right now, and quite frankly, I am extremely heartbroken about the fact that my boyfriend just disappeared on me. Saying that, if you look at my instagram - you will see a pretty going out girl,  drinking champagne, dancing in the clubs, taking pictures of cocktails and flowers in the food or sunbathing on the beaches of sunny places. I spend money on travelling and shoes, these are the only things that make me happy lately. Inside I'm sad and crushed. Sometimes I do light drugs to make me feel better, but not often. I am not rich, but my brain allows me to make for a more or less good living. I live in a big city full of cold-hearted people, and the one kind-hearted person just disappeared on me. I can't help but think something is wrong with me. I try to be nice and kind to people, always trying to put myself in their shoes, yet I can say no when I have to. I have been through so much sh*t in my life that I have no idea how to get out of another failure and I have no desire. I have researched a lot of forums on this subject, I might postpone yet again, but for how long, and is it worth it?@@4
597@@ 21 (almost 22) year old college student. I've been feeling really purposeless lately. This year, since I turned 21, it has hit me that I am older and people view me as an adult. But I don't feel like an adult. Now I am about to turn 22 and I don't have much to show for it. Pretty average. I want to be noteworthy in some way to people (in a positive way). I make the Deans List in school every semester. A big part of me wants to keep from burning bridges in case I do start turning myself around. For that reason, I put fourth a moderate effort in school and I work a lot to save up money. There are so many bad people in the world. There are people that don't care about you, people who will gladly screw you over, and people who will go out of their way to make your day worse. Sometimes they will do all three in one action. I have severe Avoidant Personality Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder. Self diagnosed. But trust me, I have them, they describe how I act perfectly. I have even tried to convince myself a million times that I don't, but I definitely do. For this reason, most people find me weird, or awkward and it is a very isolating feeling. Actually, it is terrible. I know I am in the vast MINORITY in the way I feel, but I could not imagine being a comfortable and outgoing person that people actually like. I am starting to accept that I will never change, whereas when I was younger and ""shy"" I just thought I would grow out of it. Nope. I have a girlfriend of 3 years and we live together. Our relationship has problems and it is extremely confusing for me. I have lashed out at her many times in completely psychotic episodes where I lose my mind. I have never laid hands on her, but by ""psychotic episodes"" I mean screaming at the top of my lungs, throwing things, breaking things, and name calling. I know I've messed up and it hurts me so bad afterward, I feel ashamed. I know I'm wrong. I love her so much. My insecurities run so deep that I get paranoid whether or not she loves me. I am not sure if she does or not. Either way she would be far better off if we broke up, but she fights for that not to happen. And yet, I am the idiot always suggesting that we break up. Why would I actively try to lose the one close relationship in my life? Because I am a depressed, insecure idiot who would love the chance to say ""congrats, you made the love of your life hate you"".....that is probably what it comes down to. Two reasons I haven't committed suicide yet: My parents and fear. I know both of my parents would be devastated if I did. I know they love me more than I can comprehend. The thought of putting them through that makes me sick. But at the same time, they don't have to live my life. As selfish as that sounds, that's the only way I can put it. They love me, but that doesn't make me feel any less lonely and empty. That doesn't change the fact that most people in the world are terrible. Doesn't give me a purpose, doesn't cure my disorders, doesn't fix my relationship. Sometimes I feel like I wish the only two people in the world that would truly care if I died (mother and father) would just turn their backs on me. That way the decision would be EASY for me. I just honestly don't know if my parents would ever be the same after. Then there are some people who would kind of care but they would move along shortly after...off the top of my head my girlfriend, brother, sister, maybe my nieces, my best friend and his family. Not really worried about extended family. And fear. I am afraid that my last minute or two alive are going to be terrifying, if I were to attempt it. My body panicking, convulsing, and whatever else could happen. That is a scary thought, but that is pretty secondary and not what is stopping me. Well, I don't know. I feel like this is just a huge unorganized rant and I probably didn't come close to expressing how I feel. If you read the whole thing, thank you so much for taking the time, I really appreciate it.@@2
598@@ I know the dictionary definition of suicide is taking your own life - right? But what about continually thinking about death and dying? Is it similar to suicide? My life has ""felt"" different ever since September of last year. I guess the catalyst for the change was a relapse in CFS/ME. This chronic condition has taken away some more ""living"" for me. Less energy, less focus, less ambition; more pain, more fatigue, more brain fog. It has impacted my work, my social life (not that I was a big social butterfly before), and my marriage. So now it's been 6 1/2 months of living a less engaged or active life ... and I find myself thinking about death and dying a lot. At least every day. I am not making any plans, I am not acquiring any means/methods, I am not finishing up any loose ends, and I am not actively working through any bucket list. But I have this strong sense of apathy - you know that inner ""meh"" you feel whenever you think, I should do the laundry/call a friend/start a new painting/ or anything that speaks of vitality or interest or meaning. And today that apathy or pointlessness is really strong. It's as if I don't really care about being alive anymore. I feel bored and unmotivated ... I go through the paces, go to work, keep the house liveably clean, wash the dirty underwear, take out the trash - you know all those menial boring daily duties that right now seem so stupid and ridiculous. As if any of it really matters! (Well, I guess having clean underwear matters to those near me.) I guess it's the depression - combined with the illness/being unwell. Yeah it is. I'm feeling depressed about being in pain, tired, and foggy. It's making me feel less connected to aliveness. Maybe I should've posted this in ""Venting"". I'm okay - I'm not at the edge or anything. Just a really really flat mood that makes me think death is not such a bad thing. What stops me though is my spiritual beliefs - and I want to stress spiritual, not religious. Somewhere deep down inside me, there is this stubborn voice that keeps telling me that I was given this sacred gift of Life and to throw it away would be very disrespectful to what I call Kitchi Manitou, or Great Spirit. And it would violate this inner value of cherishing the sacredness of life. I do - I value all of life. Especially the children. These little people also keep me wanting to stay alive, even if it's to give them one more hug or one more word of encouragement. That's really what is keeping me going right now. But I'm merely existing, not living. I guess that's okay, isn't it? Coasting for a while? But I really really miss moving myself - ""swimming"" if you want to look at it metaphorically. As in, propelling myself with intent and purpose and hope and courage. So maybe I should've posted this in ""Grieving"". Sorry everyone for my meandering! But this is therapeutic ... so thank you if you read this, and if you have something to say about this TTL topic. I hope you all keep safe and stay alive tonight. Cuz there's be an empty space in the world without you, and that would be really sad.@@4
599@@ My name is T and im 17, ive always fucking hated living. If its not one thing its the other, my family is terrible. when i was 13 my father died from a accident. i saw him dead. and my mother got married to my shit head of a step dad 4 months later. (who goes out of town for weeks at a time.) you know what the first thing the only father figure in my life tells me when i dont see him for 3 weeks? he calls me a lazy pot head. yes, i have a drug addiction but only because im so fucking depressed, ive been experimenting with drugs.  i cant do anything right. my mom constantly tells me to go fuck myself and she hates me, also that my depression isnt real and its all just a act. i just dont know what to do. im not killing myself today or anything..  im ugly, my bestfriend has also tried to kill himself and he would have if i didnt drive to his house at 3 am in the morning and struggle with him. how the fuck do people live with this? ive realized ill never make anything of myself. im worthless, i just want to kill myself. please help me.@@1
600@@ I have been thinking about suicide every day for years. It's so wrong and unfair. Nobody should have to go through this. Basically I'm 19 now and never had any friends, relationships or anyone who ever wanted me or cared about me. Basically I have been bullied and isolated pretty much all my life. Treated like a freak and not even human. It's caused so many problems for me like no self confidence, shyness and no self esteem. Every day I go to college I sit in silence just thinking about suicide. Watching all the winners love carefree and happy, I'm relationships, friends, excitement while I just the inferior garbage nobody cares about that will die alone. There isn't even any point in trying to talk to them. Not much in common, totally different lives. Even that isn't it. Even if I tried to talk to them I would just end up being made fun of or rejected or viewed as an inferior loser. I'm crying while I type this. Nobody cares about me. Nobody loves me :(. I'm all alone in life and I never did anything wrong. Everyone views me as an inferior freak not worth even looking at. :( I don't know if I can take it anymore. I've missed out on so much in life already and I don't want to die alone :( I just want to be a normal person with people who love and care about them. Is that too much too ask?  I'm crying, I'm all alone and lonely nobody loves me or cares about me. Maybe not everyone is meant to win in life. Maybe some people just aren't meant to make it@@1
601@@ :(, I'm crying because nobody cares about me.@@5
602@@ So let me begin with the basics, I am not in danger of self slaughter currently, but I do have my sights set on death by age 30 (4ish years from now).  I'm a male, single, employed (for now). I thought talking about my justification for suicide would be useful for me, in that, I can be exposed to new perspectives, write out my reasons and see them on paper, as well as be challenged, and challenge others.   You see I want my death to be an informed decision, not a grave mistake.  So with that said I don't know if this is the right forum to be talking about it, if it is not, than please direct be to a more appropriate one. So lets start off with my abilities: I have a terrible time focusing and staying on task, recalling information on the spot, expanding my thoughts, retaining incoming information, poor with reading and writing, slow at processing information, and difinately view the world in an odd manner, and probably a limited one due to cognitive disabilities. I have so many problems that I am really not sure how I am going to get them all down and recall them.... So let me attempt to recall my motives for wanting death opposed to life. My life is going to be tremendously difficult (painful, humiliating) to live (work, social) I am an incredibly envious person I want particular things out of life that I am coming to discover are simply out of my league for a person of my capabilities. I am unwilling to adjust my basic goals or standards for a good life I refuse to live out my life as a pathetic individual I don't want my only existence to be a nightmare, a world gone wrong. I don't like myself for things I cannot change (mental speed etc) Life doesn't have much to offer a person like me. I believe suicide to be just in many circumstances, and in some cases honorable. (but still selfish) I will expand on my points and problems upon request.@@1
603@@ I want to suicide. I feel like everything is falling apart and has been for past 5 years, I feel that the only way out of this pain is suicide. I have never felt so depressed in my life.@@1
604@@ I just feel like killing myself. Why not, right?@@1
605@@ I think about it alot, a end to my misery and failed life.  Years ago I was diagnosed with schizoaffective.  For those who do not know that is depression and schizophrenia.  While my meds have kept it in check for years, its been an ongoing struggle to find a med that doesnt have side effects on me.  Right now I'm suffering from Tardive Dyskensia, random movement of the neck and in my case lips.  I cant go in public like this.  All my dreams are gone.  I have lost my independence, my job, my apartment, any hope of meeting a cute girl or a chance at a family of my own.  I am already 40 and I live at home with my parents and sister.  All I do is exist while I eventually wait to die anyway. I want to go out on my terms, not at the mercy of this illness and medication side effects.  I want to go out as a normal human being with my sanity.  I cant live like this waiting for the symptoms to return or continue with this weird movement with my lips i cannot control.  Its hard to eat, hard to talk and hard to sleep.  I need to find a way to put this miserable existance away.  I dont want to live like this further.@@1
606@@ iÂ´ve lost everything i use to care about... itÂ´s been a long way, a long and painful path my decisions took me to... my wife left with my two kids (to another country) 4 years ago,my brother steal the company we build together (a couple of months before my wife left). Anyway, i tryed to start over, build a new company, had a new relationship but nothing seems to work, not when all i have in my mind is all this time i lost without my kids, and now, after 4 years i came to the realization that my kids no longer remember me as theyr father... i have no way to go where they live now (i canÂ´t get a visa) and iÂ´m feeling more and more useless... i donÂ´t eat, i canÂ´t sleep... all i have is my mother and she is the only reason why i havenÂ´t take my life so far... but, i donÂ´t think that is fair... i mean, itÂ´s been 4 years, and if anything iÂ´m worst than ever... to live hurts me so much... every single day of my life i wake up crying and yelling that i want to die... i had a good life, i had everything i wish for... i donÂ´t have much regrets... but i think this is it...@@2
607@@ i am not here in this life for me. i am only here for everyone else. so broken and so alone. having everyone's back, and no one ever having yours, except to keep you here to take care of them, until they can replace you. i don't need to be here. i am just a body that does work, a brain that does finances and a mouth that tells everyone how great they are. and when one of those fails, i am a useless entity. i failed. so why keep eating? why drink water? i wasn't supposed to notice, but now i do. i wasn't supposed to be born. i wish i could just turn off feelings. maybe i will learn how.@@4
608@@ My partner has recently been having sex with someone else and now I know I'm not good enough i'm pretty much done. We spoke about opening up the relationship up but I honestly never thought it would happen. I can't express the rejection I feel. I can't think straight, I can't feel anything. I don't know what to do. I'm just done.@@4
609@@ I am a lawyer deep in student debt with a medium-salary job that isn't sufficient to even service the interest on the debt. As a result, my balance increases every month, even though I make my minimum payment under the IBR program. My best case scenario is that I make these minimum payments for 25 years, and then the balances are forgiven, but the forgiveness will be taxable--with interest, the forgiveness amount will likely be nearly $1 million, which will make me permanently insolvent. I hate practicing law, do not get along with my coworkers, resent many of my clients, and do not feel engaged at the office. For the past two years I have been working an exit strategy- have applied for jobs teaching business law at community college, working at a public interest law organization, even jobs that would require leaving the practice of law for something completely unrelated. All have been dead ends. The only job interviews I get are with other second tier law firms doing exactly what I do now and hate. While I have objectively good credentials (top 1/3 of my class at Ivy League law school, editor of law journal, academic awards, etc), I am not actually very good at my job, and it takes so much of my time (partly because I am depressed an therefore unfocused/inefficient, but partly because law practice is just very time consuming) that I basically have no time to enjoy life. And I work so many long hours only to be digging myself deeper and deeper into financial insolvency every day because of compounding interest. If I cannot find something else to do with myself, and nobody outside my field is interested in hiring me, I feel like the rest of my life is simply not worth living. My student loans are discharge able upon my death (but not in bankruptcy), and I have over $300k in life insurance, which will be payable even in the event of suicide (there is a special rider, and the waiting period has elapsed). I love my wife very dearly, and she is the only reason I have not killed myself already. However, I feel like I am not truly present for her, because all I think about is my hatred of my professional life, and that the best thing I can do for her and for myself is to kill myself as painlessly as possible, and leave her a modest legacy of life insurance proceeds.@@1
610@@ Things have been getting worse year by year. This time last year I remember telling myself ""wow things can't POSSIBLY get any worse than this"" and they did. I'm 25 and: - no proper career established - single - no real friendships - suffering from HAIR LOSS as a female! I might as well be dead. - living at home because I've wasted the past few years of my life at school - no money of my own since I have to pay for my own tuition since my family is poor - POOR Just fuck my life. 5 years ago I thought I was turning my life around and setting it in the proper direction to enjoy my 20s. I've enjoyed 1 year of my 20s (at 20), liked 2 years (at 21 and 23) and have been miserable for the rest. It's a compounding effect. I have no money so I wasted my life studying for impossible goals so I ended up stressed and lost my hair so I ended up not going out much and losing my friends, etc. And then to make matters worse my friends all thing I'm ""negative""...I mean I'm suffering from depression and want to kill myself, am I supposed to be positive? But I opened up about something that's very personal to me (the hair loss) to a friend who I thought would understand and I told her that year after year I feel like I'm losing things I love about myself and my life and I can't go on like this. All she told me is to stop being so negative and then when I replied to her she saw the message but didn't bother to reply back or contact me for a week. I just let it go...I mean who really needs friends? All I see is all these people on instagram having an amazing life with nothing that seems to be wrong while I'm here depressed with every aspect of my life in a complete mess. This hair loss struggle is the last straw for me. It's been falling out for the last 6 months. I'd rather die before more hair falls out. Like I'm already struggling with enough shit did I REALLY need another thing to hate about myself and my life on top of it?@@5
611@@ I'm so broken and I am unable to bear the heartache of rejection anymore. i just NEED to die. My beautiful girlfriend has abandoned me. She says she cares but her actions show that she doesn't even give me a passing thought. Yet we were perfect together and she told me she had never been so sure of anything than of her love for me. The look in her eyes said she wasn't lying. And yet now... I'm always there for other people, I was there for her when she felt down. But there's just no-one there for me. I don't want pity. Just to die and stop all this crying and heartache. I just want it to stop@@3
612@@ people don't really care for each other, they hate you for doing the right thing. My therapist says i should live for the respect of life. I just want to go home, i have been fighting for 38 years whens it going to be enough?@@2
613@@ I don't believe I've ever posted in this thread, to my recollection, I could be mistaken however. That being said, let me start. I've endured too much in my life & right now is just breaking me down, so far, that I can't see ""asking"" what's the point any more? I mean, in all honesty, there's really no one in my real life, that would miss me IF I would ""end"" this miserable exsistance that I'm enduring. People can ""say"" there's much to live for, like the (good) example of my future grandchild. That being said, that's not something that's going to occur, due to my daughter's treatment(s) of myself. I'm already as low as one person's able to handle, yet she's the one ""complaining"" that she doesn't want anything to do with me because I'm ""on her"" for one thing or another. I guess she no longer wants to ""deal"" with me any more. I find it , when she makes her unwise choices, people are to scramble to fix her issues/problems, with no execption to whatever's going on with their own life. When I need some support, with my life, she's the first one to turn on me, along with the rest of the world I live/exsist in. There's no compassion for someone like myself & it's futher shoved in my face on a daily basis. I'm tired of ""doing this"" on a daily basis. I'm not without my own faults, mistakes, or even unwise choices on my own behalf. I gave up gambling, because it was unproductive & causing myself more damages then I could control. Seems the harder I've tried to fix/repair myself, so to speak, the worse things have become. It's not too little to late either kind of concept(s). I've made some serious sacrifices for other people. Some, like my daughter, was to try to help her. Other things that have plagued me, for years, are things that I didn't do to anyone else, but yet it's had a devistating effects within my life, because of what someone/people have done to me. I've delt with things, as they've occured. I can't keep doing damage control, when things are so far out of my own control(s). This place was the last shred of hope I held out & on to. It's now going, as is my life taking a turn to a place I never thought I'd never post in or post in again. I'm done with being the laughing stock of this world, the people I encounter, or people that I have to endure with on a constant basis. I'm tired of my depleating health issues, that are now becoming worse, due to the amount(s) of stress/pressure I'm enduring right now. I've been lashing out, at my poor dog, when he's done not a dang thing to deserve my 'wrath.' I've become bitter, jaded, angry, hateful, spiteful, & all the unpleasant feelings that seem to be flowing through me, just like my blood does. I'm tired of suffering & there's no one that truly cares to even acknowledge me any more. It's just best to avoid me, because I'm falling, face down, & why would anyone offer to lend me a hand to help me back up? They wouldn't & that's abundently clear, as this time's coming to it's conclusion(s). It's better to laugh at me, avoid me, or like the guy across the street seems to keep telling me, to just continue to take whatever life tosses at me. I no longer can deal with this any more. I can't find a place, I'm losing this home, I have no family/friends, so there's no one to talk to in my life. I'm exhusted of complaining, when nothing turns out for the better. I held out hope, too many times in my life, & there's nothing left & hope's run out. I'm tired of people around me, gloating about what's happening to me. I had the lady next door (married one) ask me, eariler today, when's the date I need to be vacant from here? She futher upset me. She cared not, what or where I was going, just how quickly I needed to be gone from here. It's dealing/talking with these people, that have their life going great, that NEVER think about their own difficult struggles/times within their own life. It seems to me, because they got over it, so very quickly & never had to endure it/things for a greater length of time, they just believe it's just a small hill to walk up. It's not the case & they should see how it feels to be on THIS END of life. As we all understand, it's not about to happen. I've had enough of the people that are unkind & have nothing to offer, in the way of a kind word or two for someone else. I'm tired of people kicking me & it never ends, even with things piling up on me. I'm burnt out from fighting a losing battle. I can't win & it's taken 40 plus years to understand/seriously comprehend it. There's nothing left for me, but being out on my butt. People can tell me go talk to someone, a professional, or a therapist. I've endure more things, than their books/classes/clients could ever give them, as a serious reality of how miserable life is. I know, I'm not the only one in this world, but my life's crashing down on me & there's nothing left in reserve to deal with this any more. I want out, simple as that. All I can say, is that I don't want to be here any more. All the pains I've endure, for far too long, has just broken me. Having no real family or friends to turn to, has just futher depleated me. Finally, being the laughing stock for other's amusement(s), has just been the final blow, that I didn't need. I don't care any more & that's the most painful thing that I could ever say. I just don't want this life any more & I don't want to keep doing this any more.@@3

This morning when I suddenly woke up, thoughts of old friends that cut me off from their lives because they moved on to the &quot;next level&quot;, the pain from it, frustration and loneliness are spinning in my mind. I want to cry and scream from the pain of betrayal from people that I thought were like my family. How could they dismiss me like that? What have I done to be thrown out like something used and not needed anymore? Was I just a stepping stone, is it all I am worth? Am I not worth to be loved and cared for by anybody? I remember how I always used to be strong and ambitious, I had so many ideas who I could become and everybody thought I would be a successful person one day. I am nothing like that anymore and I haven't become anything. I look in the mirror and I don't recognize a person there. My voice is weak, I walk with my neck sunked in my shoulders and I can't bear a straight eye contact, I feel like a looser. Something inside of me broke 2 years ago and I can't repair it, I don't know where I can go to find the strength. Feels like there is no more place for me on this earth, there is no other person than my mom who cares to know if I am even alive. People walked on me and used me so much that when I meet anybody, I can't let them get to know me. I am so scattered I don't know where to start getting myself back together and then I think: what's the point. I am 29. The best years that I could have, I will never have a chance to relive them again. This 2 years were wasted, they were lost in the darkness of depression and loneliness. Even if my situation ever improve, I will always have a scar on my heart, I will never be able to be happy, like I could before this happened to me.@@3
616@@ I have been fighting with ptsd for 6 years now. I have a hard time being around people that lie or that have criminal records. It makes me feel sick to my stomach, I start feeling high anxiety, if I don't get away from them quickly I start getting angry. I have done some things that I have regretted in this state of anger. But I have worked hard in therapy. And, it all changed for me when my son was born, I was so happy, I had a 1000 photos of him on my phone. I stopped going to school so I could spend more time becoming the best mother that I could. Every time that my husband's parents criticized me and brought up the past, I just told myself that I was happy now and that I was going to Live in the now. I did evey thing that they ask for and went over to their house every other weekend. On Christmas they ask me to be next to my sister-in-law who has a long criminal record and has threatened, lied and manipulated my husband. We've had heated fights in the pass, I have try to explain why it's hard for me to be next to her, they don't seem to want to listen. But I was feeling better for a year now, so I said yes. But when I was their, I was just quiet and stayed to myself. And I heard them say that my problem was that I was jealous that they liked her better. I don't care about things like that, what hurts is that I have opened up myself to them and tryed to explain my circumstance, they seem to want to push for something that I'm not capable of giving to them at this point in time. After Christmas they've treated me like shit, they commented on my weight, my appearance, my parenting skills. I have Gotten so bad that I have gone back on medicine and therapy. I am back where I started crying all the time reliving ever f*** up thing that has happen and resenting giving birth to my son. I feel so bad for him that he has a mother that is so f*** up, I wise that I wasn't in his live so that he could have a better chance to be normal. I just wise that I had killed myself when all this started six years ago, then no one would have had to suffer because of me.@@2
617@@ My depression has got bad, things were good, but I feel like I lost everything I love and feel alone. I've been thinking of suicide, I tried it once in the past, didn't work, but I wanted to try to talk to someone. I'm phone shy so I came here@@1
618@@ I don't really know how I got to this forum or why I'm actually making a post. Here goes. I'm a 25 year old bipolar, recovering alcoholic. 5 years sober. The past 6 years have been filled with tumultuous relationships, trying to find some sort of idea of what being truly loved felt like. Men who used me, beat me, stole from me, sold drugs out of my home.. I've been hospitalized about 6 times for failed suicide attempts, the last hospitalization being last January. That was not my last attempt though, the last was in June. I usually use things I keep lying around 'just in case'. Just in case I want to kill myself. I am in over my head with debt. I'm about to lose my car. I'm driving around uninsured. I can barely pay my rent. I'm dealing with awful body pain. I cannot, for the life of me, keep doing this. I don't want to do this anymore. There's nothing left for me. Everyone would be much better off without me. I just upset everybody, or they worry. When will her next breakdown be? And this is not worry because they don't want anything to happen. It's because when it does happen, it's so inconvenient for them. I barely get visits in the hospital. They barely answer my calls. Why do I bother?  Nobody fucking cares. I don't know why I'm even posting this. You people don't know me, so it's not like you can feel any sort of anything about me.@@1
619@@ After my vent this afternoon.... after a relative nice but but boring night out, a girl that likes me which is nice to know has kinda upset me today and it is more than a final straw for me. I dont use faebook, and i havnt done in about three years. My account is still active but im not on it. She decided to have a look through and look at previous posts and tbh that im okay with and then she did the one thing that hurt my feelings. She brouht up my ex. The one hat is responsible for me being so fucked up now. The one that ruined my life.  She started by sending a picture of me and her that i hadnt seen in years and then said oh shes really hot and started looking at her facebook and she was telling me things i didnt really want to know. &lt;y past had been getting me down alot and i feel like now im in a new relationship (kind of) its caught up with me again. I genuinely feel like the only way to get away from my past is to not be around at all@@2
620@@ First off, don't feel disheartened reading this if you're at the beginning of your help. As much as I feel awful, I know it's been worse. In all honesty, feeling like I do now and knowing I'm still here is making me realise how strong I was to not do anything in the past. I haven't been tempted with thoughts of suicide for a long time. I can't quite pin down how many years. Just under ten I'd say. It was from the ages of 13-15 that I was my worst. I had thoughts of hoping I'd come to a misfortune, but they were fleeting. Day or two at most. I've had a bit of a relapse. Through various pressures home/work/money/relationships/rent, I've just hit back down to how I was. Not my rock-bottom, but my old usual level. There's a bottle of wine and half a bottle of vodka left in the kitchen, and thank the Gods I know better than to drink them. I tried to reach out. I was texting my partner since yesterday afternoon literally begging them to come to my house. It's really out of character for me to be like that. I guess it scared them, they would wait a minimum of an hour to reply. Maybe if I'd admitted that I was feeling these urges they would have come over. I just didn't know how to tell someone who means that much to me that I was considering leaving forever. Even in the past, I never really did. I think I maybe told my mother after coming home ridiculously late one night. I'd been at a possible suicide attempt. I kept thinking about who would find me though. How much that would ruin their life, and that I'd just be passing my pain onto another person in a way. That's the only thing that stops me. If I knew I wouldn't be found. If there was like a magical way to do it, which would leave no remains, I would have done it. Back then, and probably today. In the end there was some sort of agreement set up with the police, that if I wasn't home a certain amount of time after school etc, they'd go out looking for me. I've been in bed all day. Just sitting there. I noticed that one of my severe warning signs were back. When I just grab at my thighs and upper arms and slowly pull, or twist the skin. So I guess I at least know what to watch out for. Being so aware is almost making it worse though. Now that I've been through it all and have had such a long period of neutral I am so aware of everything that I'm doing and I know what it means now. I'm just kinda scared stupid. I have no idea how I pulled myself out of all of that last time. I was a kid. I did stupid things. I ended up self-medicating and dropped a shoe size. My body won't last that happening a second time. I can't tell my family. They live over an hour away and they're so busy. I wouldn't want them to think it's all happening all over again. As much as I have these strong urges, I have this equal side just telling me I can't. That I should work out what to do. I'm trying to focus purely on that one. A few of my problems are completely out of my control though. I just wanted my partner there, but they've never known me ill. After the way they were talking today saying that they had no idea what was going on with me, why was I acting that way, what was so wrong, I kinda feel like I've lost them too now. Ironically this would be the first time I've felt like this and not been trying to push someone away. I've spent the whole day trying to calm myself down and read self-awareness articles, it's just not really helped. Though it has toned down a little. It's more coming in waves now. I never thought I'd feel like this again. I feel like I've let myself down and just wasted all of the years I spent on getting better. On the plus side, minus my skin pulling and twisting, I haven't fallen back into any old self harm habits. Has this happened to anyone else? Did you manage to get back up again? What helped? Kinda desperate here. So don't worry if it's something small. The small things are sometimes the ones with the biggest effects.@@5
621@@ I don't even know where to start. My life is filled with emotional and physical pain as well. My parents were always negative to me and told me I was worthless, never amount to anything, I'm a bum and they called me racist names because of the people I chose to be around and my kids are mixed and my parents say racist names about my kids other half of their race right in front of my kids. My parents kicked me out and left me to die on the streets now they are trying to take custody of my kids because I'm poor and have no place of my own to take my kids to come live with me. I miss my kids every day. I thought I'd be able to watch them grow up and I'll never even get to see them again. I ended up marrying an abusive man. I have no one to talk to, nowhere to go, no one ever has helped me, no true friends. My husband beat me up outside while I was pregnant and people outside called the police and he went to jail and when I went back to his mother's house where I lived with him all his family ganged up and me, threatened to beat me up some more and threw all my bags out on the front lawn. I went to a shelter after that and it was awful. There were so many bed bugs in the cracks of the bunk beds and they bit me up from head to toe it was so painful. I'd rather be dead than to live in a women's homeless shelter. People stole from me in their it was hell. Sometimes I wished my husband would just kill me so I can get this nothing life that I have over with. I keep getting denied SSI, denied section 8, fired from every job because I have such severe depression I have no energy and tired all the time I sleep too much so I always over sleep and I'm late everyday at every job I  ever had and they all fire me. I'm even late to job interviews. Then people call me lazy, say I am not trying hard enough, it's my fault I'm getting beat up because I continue to stay with him out of financial reasons because if I left I'd in be homeless and die, (his family let me move back in when he got out of jail and he told them he wanted me back at the house with them or else he would leave and stop paying their rent with the only money he has so they let it be because they want his money). I have no money to do anything. All I get is link card and it's not enough. I have a 5 month old baby now and I'm about to lose her. I ran out of formula for my daughter and she has to go one day without formula because I'm broke, and her coupons don't start up until tomorrow so she has to miss a bottle. I wish my husband would just kill me. Why is God making me go through this and suffer everyday? I have no reason to live anymore.@@2
622@@ I self-harmed today. I have not hurt myself in sixth months but this feels natural, since I am such a reject loser, I might as well treat my body and self as such. I keep thinking about hurting my face since it is so ugly and no girl has ever wanted anything to do with me. Not a single girl was ever interested in me and I am 27 years old. I tried online dating, and I have never gotten a single date or response because I am so ugly. I have to kill myself, I just don't want to hurt my mother. But I don't like living, I don't like life, all the false hope and illusion....meanwhile@@1
623@@ I wish I could kill myself tonight. The urge is so strong. I am only staying alive because of my mother. She is the only one who cares and loves me. I am only living for her and have been for a while. I can't kill myself tonight so i guess that means back to harming my body some more, since I am such a piece of shit.@@1
624@@ I came to this forum to post about depression,  and to just have somewhere to write my feelings, without worry that friends or family will see it. However, everytime I talk about how I feel, all I can think about is the ease of ending everything. I can't post there so I have come here. Whilst there are many things that could contribute, the overriding feeling is a lack of hope in my future. I don't like to be that guy who whines about it, but I'm never going to be a success financially, romantically or in any other way. I'm sick of people telling me how nice a guy I am. Because at the end of the day, that means nothing. It just means that however many years down the line, I will be a nice failure. All my current friends will move on with their future ventures in life, and I will still be just about making it, probably contemplating suicide daily still. I don't really know where I'm going with this post. I guess just to put it out there. I don't even know whether I will ever kill myself. There have been a couple of close calls, but maybe it's just one more thing that I can't even do.@@3
625@@ Here i am, 17 years old, doing the higher studies, mommy and daddy were proud and i got everything i desired, yet i never wanted anything. All my days were filled with going to school and playing on the computer, i sometimes went to the pub with friends from school but that didn't really make me happy. But it should, i should've been happy at those times, everybody always talked about our nights like they were the best of our lives. Why didn't i feel like that too? I became depressed and needed child psychology when i was 16 because i told my parents that i'm never happy and want an end to this stupid life of me. It was my biggest mistake ever; my mom wouldn't stop crying and tell me not to do ""stupid things"", the therapy was a total failure and my 3 only friends made fun of me being like this. I swallowed the jokes and insults of them for more than a year, i then screamed at their faces and told them that i will no longer take their shit. They were all very surprised as if they didn't even know how pathetic they were behaving but anyways... Now i have no more friends, my grades are so bad, i'm incredible bored all day and just sleep as much as i can. Everybody thinks my suicidal thoughts are gone and the therapy helped, but they aren't and i feel even worse than before i admitted to being suicidal. i just have absolutely no interest in anything and i don't even want to make new friends because i'm so sick of everything and everybody. i might just fail my last year in middle school because i can't concentrate anymore but why would it even matter, as if something more fun is waiting for me next year..@@4
626@@ I don't see any reason to live at all, and the tiny shreds of hope that I had have been recently taken away, so what's the point now to even bother??? I know, I know I'm not supposed to talk about faith in the general forum, but I feel I've been fooled by someone that I thought was of high true faith, and that was really all I was hanging on to. This has hurt me to my very core that I was being fooled by a ""fake"", and I have no idea on just how to carry on now. Even realizing this recent hurtful 99.99% possibility, I still feel I'm being protected by my faith (being oh so careful with my wording here). However, If things don't turn around for me over the next few months, I'm just done, and will be putting and end to this miserable existence. I have no interest to call a hotline, and don't want to be hospitalized (again), because all I do is bullshit my way out when I realize there really is no help for some people with certain types of mental illness. Now, I'm questioning weather or not I'm in in fact a religious wacko. I don't not like myself, and this is because I don't feel I live up to what my fait requires. I just don't know how to be ""without faith"" (again careful wording), or practice hedonism. My pleasures is by showing love to others, and this is in conflict with seeking pleasure for myself. I have no idea even why I'm creating this thread, because there isn't much anybody could tell me right now to make me feel much differently about my situations. I've just had it.@@3
627@@ I'm going to talk a little bit about why I feel this way, it's not something I usually tell anyone.Most people do not understand how stressful it is for me, school and all, it's because when I was in 8th grade, I attempted to suicide, that was a really hard time for me, I switched schools after that in 9th grade and being bullied there made me lose it again, in that same year I tried to kill myself so my parents let me skip that one year, the next year I could switch schools. I hadn't recovered from it, no one was of much help in my family, they started to take it lightly, even though I harmed myself very often then, that year, I failed to pass my final exams and because my parents didn't sign this form that was suppose to save my school year, I had to repeat that grade again and of course i switched schools, that year they told me I'd be kicked out of the school if I failed and I would have to give my exams privately. This year, I'm suppose to start 11th grade but I failed two of my exams of 10th grade so I have to give a retest, but the thing is, there's too much of a fear of failure, people don't get how hard it is when you've missed so many years because of your depression and all the people you know of, only mock you for it, and my parents have already given up on me, they say that I will end up somewhere, and they never hear if I did good on a test or anything, they're never happy, but that's okay, I understand that they're ashamed to have me, I hear it everyday. Its my fault though, I'm too discouraged to study, too afraid, if I happen to fail now, I'll surely kill myself and that is my final decision.@@2
628@@ just really want to get this out. dont care who reads or sees it... the hate inside of me has been rising inside of me to a point where i cant really quell it anymore. hate for myself and this mental mindfuck that has taken over my life. allergies that prevent me from doing anything. this bone crushing pressure in my head. this condition has no treatment and im finished trying to fight it. im just finished. im so dejected and in such despair. im fuckin done. the pain has long been past my threshold. time to fucking do myself in. it really is. its gotten so ridiculous. one thing thats on my mind is my anger and rage towards women. it started with my mom and earlier this year it has been rising. i have no love for women. i want to but i hate females. i just cant deal with this obsession in my mind thats grown to outrageous levels. always looking and craving validation from women. fuck. its so annoying. i always think about it. with men i can interact without really caring but with women its different and its become so annoying. to always be thinking about what women think of me. blah blah blah. fuck. always caring about how they perceive me and if theyre attracted to me. i always need the attention on me and its become a curse. im a pretty good looking guy and have had my share of beautiful girls in my life -- its just become fuckin overwhelming to always be thinking about this. when there are myriad more important things than women to be thinking about i always care. im tired of caring. im tired of comparing myself to other guys and gauging why they might be more attractive than me. fuck its a curse. no mental peace with this shit. always from one thought to the next. and if i dont get that particular womans attention and compliments it eats away at me. its like i cant just have one or two girls giving me attention -- gotta have it all. it wasnt always like that either. it was after i started learning how to pick up girls with stupid bullshit books that lie and teach stupid shit that doesnt work -- it changed and transformed and deluded me into believing all these fallacies about myself and women. changed my nature. nothing was organic anymore., so frustrating. fuck. nothing can be natural now with a woman. im always looking for a certain reaction or outcome. cant just be friends with a girl it always has to be romantic. AND its like i dont even feel any romantic feelings for women anymore. its just like -- if you're a woman then i want to try to get u into me and feeding my ego. or validating my brokenness. it fuckin sucks. then when i put myself out there and i DONT receive the validation it destroys me. beacuse i have been with really beautiful girls when i dont get that standard of woman i get enraged and deeply insulted. fuck. tired of being somebody im not. tired of putting on faces for people -- whether that be for women or other people or trying to mask my pain. or whatever the fuck just fuck it all. i need to die and im sick and tired of censoring my feelings and emotions for other people. ive went through more shit than most people combined in their whole lives. i know that. im so young too. so much trauma and one thing after another. no release and reprieve from the incessant pain... always drowning always suffocating. kills me. tired of feeling desperate for someone to save me or love me. part of me feels really ugly inside because of this condition and all the shitstorm of emotions that have flooded me because of this shit. i feel unlovable inside. i cant receive or feel love. i dont feel it. at all. its all just a face. i feel nothing but rage and hate. nothing but hopeless and despair and depression. just darkness of the darkest night. no moon no stars no light. i want to die. i want to stop this torment. fuck wt. women treat men better and stop being shit bags. i hate feeling unattractive when i know i am. i hate feeling insecure and weird and creepy when i know im not. and i used to gfeel like the cool guy who got his girl that he wanted. fuck its annoying. to not feel in control of your life and your mind and feelings. not knowing how to control anything its so defeating. my life is in shambles and im at wits end with how to keep going. im angry at myself and the drugs and david and albert and so many fuckin people for leading me to the point i am at in my life. so many people that slowly destroyed my life one tiny decision at a time. im nothing like i once was. ive hurt so many people. it weighs on me. yet i feel so numb cuz of the anger and hate. does anybody truly love me? i definitely dont feel it....is it possible to love me? theres a woman in my life who claims to love me. i dont believe her and i rly resent her. yet she loves me. its like wtf. i dont fuckin know anymore. kill me now.@@4
629@@ I have been suicidal for almost 5 years now and it is due to hair loss.  Having a full head of hair is absolutely integral to my ability to feel handsome and comfortable in my own skin, and to my enjoyment of life.  I noticed my hair loss very late so no amount of preventative medication or any other type of current treatment can really help me out at this point.  Not to mention, I was on anti-depressants for a number of years, which I believe triggered the premature onset of my hair loss, a fact that I didn't even know until it was too late.  I have also experienced terrible side effects from finasteride, which is the most common medication to prevent hair loss today.  And I am not about to wear a wig.  Life is just not worth living anymore and I always wish I would just fall asleep and never wake up.  I cry out to God to relieve my pain and He does absolutely nothing.  I don't know where else to turn or what else to do.  Life is just hopeless.@@3

631@@ I've been contemplating suicide for several years. I'm 46 and my father committed suicide in 1975 when I was seven. All these years I've just wanted to know why he would do that to his family. I'm completely miserable pretty much all the time. I play a good role in pretending to be ""normal"" but I'm dying on the inside. I have a good career, very smart daughters (19 & 22), and pretty much everything I could have asked for in life. My relationship with my wife of 27+ years is great when it's great and terrible when it's terrible. I'm not looking for anyone to try to convince me not to kill myself, just looking for the most effective and painless method. I know the forum rules do not permit this so I won't ask for advice. I just want to end it for myself and those around me that I make suffer due to my sadness. My family deserves better and I know that.@@2
632@@ Why fucking bother? I've never had a girlfriend, have no future, I just take up space. I'm just going to mooch off my family until I die alone and bitter. Sure, jumping off the bridge would hurt them at first, but it'd be kinder in the long run. I never expected to make it to twenty, and maybe I should have become a fortune teller, because it certainly seems that way. The world is a terrible fucking place, I hate everyone and everything, I wish we'd get it over with and just nuke each other already. Excuse the crassness of it, but it's time to ""shit or get off the pot"" humanity. The majority of you don't deserve what you have, most of you are human cockroaches, and the rest are too fucking stupid to understand what the hell is going on. Fuck it. I'm just going to get shitfaced, and stumble off a bridge. Can't wait for everyone at school to pretend they gave a fuck for a whole three days before they forget I ever existed.@@1
633@@ Hey friends.... First of all, sorry for all the spelling mistakes I might make... I'm from Denmark, but I'll try my best in english... Well, I think many of you maybe have thought about the queston ""what if I just was gone?"" and ""What would happen then?""... I do... year, I have thought about it a lot, for a while now... ""who will cry? and who will care? Who will honestly miss you"".... I have to say, that I'm not an unpopular girl, actually I have pretty many ""friends"".. or so the rest of the world think... the fact is, that I only think I have 1 real friend... He's name is Jakob... I think he might be the only one, who really gonna miss me, besides my family... Have you guys ever read or seen the story about Hazel Grace, ""The Fault in Our Stars""? There is a guy, in the book, who says something like: everybody will be forgotten at some time, and someday you'll be not on any mind anymore... you'll just end up like nothing.... And I think the author, John Green, is right.... at the end I maybe don't matter to anyone... Not even my family... they'll get over it at a time... I am crying myself into sleep, but still smiling to the world, maybe even more than all they other people, just to be sure, that they wont see through me.... I really don't think anyone will miss me that much... the few ones, who will miss me, like my family and Jakob, have a lot of other ""friends"".... year, I think they will cry, but they'll also get over it... Sorry for this depressing post, but I just have to come out with it somewhere.... it's late now... over midnight, but I'm not tired... but I have to make myself fall in sleep now, so I can wake up tomorrow, and make sure everything seems normal....@@5
634@@ Hello, I am also schizoaffective. I am only 26, yet already after 10 years of in and out of psychosis they probably will give me a disability pension which means soon I will be disabled for real lol... I am just existing and I cry every day. My concentration is gone so I cant read books or watch movies, i feel no joy, no happiness, only a chronic headache that was added to my symptom list 4 months ago and I really hope it is a brain tumor. I fantasize about it being a brain tumor. If it's not i will probably end up with tardivde dyskinesia too in a matter of time. Life sucks. I wonder how long it will take, waiting it out. When will I get cancer, or a heart attack? Will I have the chance to refuse treatment for for example breast cancer at 34, or do I have to endure this state I am in for 50 years? I long for a quick fix too, every day, my thoughts are really one track minded and it makes me cry, i am lonely and it makes me cry, i have to to escape to my mothers for emotional support i cant be alone more than a few days whithout psychosomatic pain building up. I do have stronger independent periods but if they last 3 months, the apathic depressed period lasts 8 months, so most time I'm having a hard time. My doctors think im going to be okay. Can you beleive it. I want them to be wrong I dont want to live anymore, no more struggle now.@@4

637@@ To me the thought of suicide, while very disturbing to most people, is very much a source of comfort during my tough, depressive times. I'll explain why- Sometimes situations get so tough to deal with when you have severe depression. Your emotions and pain can become so extreme, that no Earthly solution seems to be strong or effective enough to stop the pain. Pretty much every time I find myself getting to this point, the thought of suicide seems to be the only possible solution that would 100% get rid of my pain. Just the thought that there is actually a fool-proof, sure-fire solution to end the depression and pain makes things better for me. This does not mean that I'm going to do it. But sometimes when I'm to my lowest points, I like to lay down, shut my eyes, and imagine that I don't exist, that I'm free of all the pain. It is a very comforting thought for me. I know it seems strange to some, but I'm a believer that we are all individually different and think/see things differently. Suicide is basically the solution to my pain and tough times that I envision when I can't possibly think of a single other solution that would help at all (which often times is the case). The thing about it is though, I believe all or most of us who suffer from severe depression view the thought of suicide as comforting. After all, most of us eventually wind up at that conclusion. That's the whole reason why, when we are to our lowest point, we reach for the solution we think will end the pain, which is often suicide. We arrive at the thought of suicide because it is a source of comfort to our minds. We are looking for solutions to our pain, and the concept of suicide offers them. I'm not endorsing suicide. I'm merely explaining how my mind thinks about it, and why I believe suicide is often the thought/action of severely depressed people.@@5
638@@ I'm past the point of wanting things to get better. I just wish I could get out of here. I'm furious all the time practically and it feels like my soul is being torn apart. This is all just too much and I never asked for all this. Its just too too much  !!@@2
639@@ Best friend died a month and a half ago. Feels like I haven't seen him in at least a year, time moves by so slow now. No job, no money, no motivation to get a job. Founded a startup business with a friend of mine, haven't contributed in two weeks, think I'm gonna step back. Isn't making me any money anyway. Been depressed/suicidal whole life, my friend was the only one I was able to talk to. Everything went downhill since he died. Another close friend of mine is masking all the pain in his life by doing a bunch of drugs. Think I might join him and get addicted to heroin. People say suicide isn't the answer but what's the point of living if I'm just going to be living in my parent's house with no job and being in a bad mood the whole time. Seems like I already am not living.@@5
640@@ S- searching for the reason to overcome self empathy. U- useless in redemption I- I am worthless C- cannot be saved I - I want to change D- does not deserve love E- everyone abandons me I am to tired now dont give up someone cares about you@@1
641@@ i dont know what to do so maybe this will make me feel better putting it out there. I am 25 and married i have no friends. im shy and its hard making friends and keeping them. except my husband but he doesnt understand how im feeling so i have stopped telling him when im depressed or my problems he doesnt deserve that to have a wife that complains so i try to seem happy with him. he tells me to stop feeling sorry for my self but its more than that. my biggest problem is my job the people i work with i cant trust them i thought me and this girl i worked with were starting to get close then everything i told her she'd tell other people so i stopped that quick then she started asking why i have been so quiet  ... and im shy so they feel like its ok to mess with me because i wont say anything. its just not who i am to go off on someone because i am so nice . i leave people alone so why cant they just leave me alone sounds simple but its obviously not. my family and i have grown so far apart i only talk to my parents once a month and never talk to my sisters and brother in less its a family get together. they dont even try to talk to me and i dont understand i have tried to talk to my mom but its like she dont want to talk to me. shes not being caring toward me ive been going through some medical problems and she never asks about it or anything i have had tell her then i stopped and i havnt her from her in a while i just don't get it if i was a mother id be talking to my child everyday to see if they were ok... what i want more than anything is to be a mother ,and with my problem i may never be able to. going through 2 miscarriages was hard and i dont think i could go through anymore. and everything else is too expensive to try. so i have to deal with that too...i dont know where to go i feel stuck in the place i am in ive been asking god to help me i've been so depressed with everything i dont know what else to do. ending my life seems like the best thing it'd be better than living my life just existing everyday and dealing with people i don't like and having no one to talk to.@@4
642@@ I've struggled with depression and bipolar all of my life. I have had several suicide attempts when I was much younger, and All have failed so far, obviously. I can't seem to feel better, ever. I try every day to tell myself that things are going to get easier, or better, or I'll make it and be happy, but I don't think that's true anymore. I hate myself. I am a culmination of fuckups. The past seven years I have triedto improve, and then, one day, I wake up and realize that my whole life has been lying to myself tthat I'll one day be okay. I'llnever be okay. Normally iI can survive. But I really did it now. I quit my job and moved out of my apartment six months ago to travel with a friend. He took five months to sell his house. Now I am out of money and homeleas and haven't traveled and have nowhere to go. I just want to die. I want to go back home, but I don'thave a home. I ddon'thave money. I ddon't know how to get back on my feet. I'm scared. And my depression set in again, and now I'mstuck. II'm staying with friends, but I know I'min the way, and iI'm sick, and tired, and tired of life. I just want to wander off quietly and die without being an inconvenience to anyone. I'm tired of trying. Life takes so much effort. Living and being happy and keeping up appearences. I don't want to do it anymore. It's been fifteen years or more, since before Iwas in my double ddigits, since I was happy. I'm just tired. I want it to be done. I want to just go to sleep and never wake up. I hate existing so much.@@3
643@@ Help! I feel all alone, sad helpless. My husband abuses me. He hates me. he never tells me he loves me anymore. I have no one in my world that tells me they love me. All my husband ever does is threaten to divorce me, throw me out onto the street, criticize me, he tells me horrible hurtful words that I just can't bear any longer. I have no where to go or run to in this cold hard world. No family that will let me live with them. No money to be independent on my own. I'm tired of starving and never have enough money to eat the whole month. No one will give me a job. Then my husband tells me my hair isn't long enough for him and he wants a woman with longer hair than mine and my hair is already very long. It goes down to the middle of my back, almost to my bottom but I have just been getting a lot of haircuts recently. I can grow it very long though and it goes to almost the middle of my back and I have had it almost down to my butt before and my husband tells me it's other women out there that have longer, nicer looking hair than me. He says there are other women in the world that are prettier than me. He keeps on telling me to take my stuff and get out of the house. I told him where am I going to go? I have nowhere to go and he says to me he don't care it is not his problem. He told me I'm going to be homeless really soon. He said he is going to throw all my stuff in the trash if I have no where to take it to. I am very scared, lonely, sad and suicidal. My psychiatrist is trying to say she is not going to treat me anymore because I am pregnant right now and high risk because I have a heart condition and she refuses to give me any medicine. So I have no medicine to take to help me with my depression and anxiety. What do I do? I wish someone would love me and show me love. That's all I want is someone to love me and nobody loves me. My own mother, father and sister and nieces all turned their backs on me and abandoned me. Even my so called friends I have tel me I should be ashamed for being pregnant and keep having kids that I have too many kids but I don't even get to be with all my children. They won't let me see them. My family kidnapped my own kids from me. My so called friend as I said before told me I need to be ashamed because I keep getting pregnant and this is the fifth time I have been pregnant. I had other pretend friends stop talking to me because they said I'm stupid for letting an abusive man get me pregnant and they don't associate with me because they said I'm dumb for allowing an abuser to get me pregnant and bring babies into a relationship where a man is abusing me. It would have been better if I never would've been born into this world. I hate my mother and father for conceiving me and bringing me into the world and letting me be born. I wish my mother had an abortion when she found out she was pregnant with me. My sister is so cruel and mean to me. I have not spoke to her in over a year because when I was speaking to her she kept on telling me lies and giving me false hopes and promises about letting me see my kids that she has. Then she kept on taunting me and teasing me in messages saying I'm so miserable of a person and she told me to admit I am miserable with my abusive husband and that I deserve to be abused since I am with him. She was laughing at me being so sad and getting abused by my husband. Why does my life have to be like this. It kills my spirit on the inside when I see other people with their families lovingly by their side, or their hospital bed, coming to visit them at visiting hours, bringing them food and gifts to the hospital, buying them gifts at holiday times and birthdays, I never get any gifts for my birthday or Christmas from anyone not even my husband. Why does God keep torturing me by letting me see other families happily together, spending quality time together and getting along. I want so much more than anything to get along with my family and have a loving, strong, beautiful, joyful relationship. I guess it is not meant for me. During my last pregnancy almost a year ago my husband hit me with a metal can and I was bleeding everywhere. I had to go to the ER and get staples in my head. No man ever did that to me before ever in my whole life. i am 33 years old and that is the first time someone ever had to get staples. Very painful but more emotionally painful for me that someone I thought is supposed to love me and protect me could do something like that to me. Plus I have a broken shattered eye socket because my husband punched me so hard with such force that it shattered the bones around my eye socket. I had to get x-rays in the ER. Then my husbands sister who is never around and doesn't even live with us and never seen anything that goes on between us came over last week for the first time and yelled at me saying to me I am a liar and that her brother never broke my eye socket. Why? Why would she say that to me? I never did anything to her. Can anyone maybe please tell me why she might say this to me and accuse me of lying after I told her I even have proof from hospital records and test results that my eye socket was broken? Why is him and his family being so cruel to me? Why is everyone always cruel and hurt me in my life. Other people get to be loved and believed why can't anyone love me and believe me and what I say? I wish things would get better so that I can stop wallowing in self pity. I think I almost overdosed last night or I actually did but I guess I am strong and my body ended up fighting it because I'm still here. But my breathing definitely was shallow, my pupils were pinpoint, it felt like my heart almost stopped beating and I had very slow movements and felt extremely fatigued. I was thinking about going to the ER because I was getting really uncomfortable and a panicky feeling but then I changed my mind and hoped I would just die but then it wore off. I don't know. The baby inside me has probably passed away. My husband doesn't want it anyways. He told me he was going to kick me in the stomach and make me have a miscarriage. But sometimes he acts like he loves it and rubs my tummy. I am so confused. I am never going to another DV shelter again. I went to one one time and it had a severe infestation of bed bugs. They are strict and make you wake up at 6am and make you stay out of your room all day and you can't go to bed until 11pm at night. If you feel sick and have a fever they don't care. They won't let you lay down and rest if you have a fever and are sick. they treat you like you are Cinderella and make you scrub the whole entire place from top to bottom every day all day long. It just aggravated my depression and anxiety more. No offense and I know someone might tell me this just trying to help and be nice but please don't tell me maybe I should go to a domestic violence shelter because that doesn't help me at all. I have already been to a domestic violence shelters and they scared me and worsened my anxiety and depression. So I have no other options. Only option I really have is to commit suicide to escape from it all.@@4
644@@ I have a very painful ear infection. i have horrible pain I can hardly get any sleep. I called an ambulance to go to the ER and they said I have swimmer's ear. It feels like someone shot me in the ear. The doctor prescribed some antibiotics pills by mouth and special ear drop and take tylenol cause I'm pregnant and it's not getting better. I've been taking the medicine for 3 days now and it isn't any better. I went back to the ER and they said there is nothing more they can do for me and told me to go to an ENT specialist but i have no way to get there. The pain has been going on for 4 days now. Plus we have no heat where I am staying and no hot water and I can't take a bath. I can't give my daughter a bath either. She is dirty and she hasn't had a bath for two weeks now due to being no hot water. We are poor where I'm living. I have no money to do anything and I had to walk home from the hospital and it is so cold here the cold air was making me get an asthma attack as I was walking in it. My daughter has to go to get her shots at the doctor office tomorrow and I have no way to get her their. the streets here have no sidewalks and it's a 10 block walk to the nearest bus stop and we would have to walk in the streets is is so dangerous with no sidewalks and 45 mph speed limit on the streets in back of where I stay. I'm just fed up of having to live like this. Why doesn't God ever bless me with anything nice. All I ever get in life is living with no money, mental and physical ailments, and abusive people that abuse me emotionally and physically. They have taken everything I ever had in life. I don't even know why I am typing this. Also my appetite is poor a lot of the times especially with my depression and this painful ear infection but sometimes I get the mood and desire to eat but I have no way to go buy any food. My food stamps came but I haven't been able to go to the grocery store due to lack of transportation and no one will help me. I haven't went to the bathroom since last week probably since last Friday... I don't want to go to food boxes at church because we went to one and the food was expired and did not tastes good. I'm so sorry i don't mean to complain but is there something wrong with wanting to be able to eat fresh non expired food that tastes good like a lot of people get to do? I don't even know if anyone will read this or not and I don't even know what I am trying to ask on here because I don't think there is anything or anyone that can help me at this point in my life. My life might as well be over now. I want to commit suicide so bad right now I just think I am too cowardly to go through with it I'll probably just make a half failed attempt at it.@@4
645@@ I used to think the world was mine, and everything I wanted to do I could if I worked for it. I slaved away at my schoolwork and tried my hardest to keep my mouth shut about my overbearing mother's tight leash. But year after year I was met with harsh criticism, and hardships that I had no way of knowing how to overcome. I proved to myself again and again how incompetent I am. In the midst of my shame, I lost all contact with my peers and became a pariah. Of course, after losing the safety of being in a group, I was signaled out and I was tormented by my classmates every day. I developed insomnia, paranoia, and severe social anxiety. Since, I have not felt like I have slept at all, and that was five years ago. I can't keep any sort of relationship for any length of time. I am always alone even when I'm surrounded by people. I hate leaving my house and I find that I have begun to hate everything. I hate people who are happy. I hate the sun. I hate people who have friends. I feel like such a detestable person, I can't even stand to look at myself. I tried to kill myself eight times but I couldn't even do that right, and now I'm here looking back on my pathetic life and I can't go on. The people that walk the earth are the bane of my existence, and every time I walk outside I feel like I'm being poisoned. I can't go on, I'm so weak. I feel like I am already dead and I'm just waiting for someone to put me in my grave. I find myself begging for the end at the beginning of every morning. What can I do when I just hate life and myself so much?@@3
646@@ Id like to believe that i could free myself from the clutches of depression, still i feel the void grow deeper, i've lost meaning, direction, empathy, i feel numb again. i want to remember what it feels like to smile, i want to remember what it feels like to dance, i want to remember what it feels like to laugh hard enough to make your chest hurt. lately it doesnt matter though. i can sit in my room and get high until i pass out from boredom, and simple conversation with strangers and friends just seems so pointless. its all the same. its all the same... what is the ultimate form of reality? the goals seem endless but they all lead to death.. so whats the point? there is none... either way i feel its necessary to float through life just to see what happens... or maybe im just to scared to kill myself.. maybe one day ill get bored enough to just do it but no one really knows. and it sucks that i have to come to a website like this one just to share that in my little head theres a man screaming at the top of his lungs while i crack a smile and shake your hand ""please to meet you no offense or whatever to regular users i just wish i actually had a friend that understood what it really felt...to not feel anything..@@3
647@@ Ive battled with myself ever since I was a kid and it seems the older i get the worse my thoughts become...Ive always had it in my head that i dont want to be on this planet but im getting a lot more reckless when in the moment And i do fear that eventually i will kill myself...ive been a self-harmer since i was 11 ....i cant have people at work know. Last year i was reckless and started up and again today attacked myself after a fight with my bf...thats a whole nother issue...im to the point in my life 30 years old and nothing to show for my life this far. I cant have children the people i care about either die or slowly fade out of my life be it my fault or not. Before my best friend passed away last yr he told me i push people away and i suppose in a way its true. I have my mom and aunt left and maybe but 3 friends and who knows if i even have a bf anymore but that whole thing has made me realize we actually Are alone in this world regardless of how close you think you may be....i have a.biological mom that has 7 kids she wants nothing to do with me real reasons unknown which in return turned my youngest sister against me as welk as my uncle and aunt that has now passed on...other siblings we never speak as we dont know each other and were never raised together....bio dad died years ago never knew him. The man that was my father passed 5 years ago and the woman that has always been mom to me moved a few hours away. Ive got an aunt that lives 5 hours from me that loves me but i still feel alone...i am alone..omce mom 83 passes i really have.noone..., the one person i always knew wpuld be there passed from cancer a yr ago at 31 and seeing the 2 people i loved most in this world besides my mom die painful horrible deaths has affected me in unmaginable ways...along with a few crazy events in my relationship w the bf....im a completw wreck. I have no purpose..i feel no worth. The struggle and hassle isnt worth it at all to me. I dont want to fight anymorebc i never wanted to be here in the first place....tonight my bf will leave mad after our blow out or more of i feel attacked bc i didnt do anything wrong...and i will be here by myself and my thoughts and i do fear what i may do with my time alone....i im already in my dark place and when the sun sets and its quiet who nows what will happen. Ive hated myself for years and im told it will get better but it hasnt and it doesnt its gotten worse and i see no point in fighting. I have no hope Its all been sucked out over the years and experiences. I ramble bc i have no one to talk to so i apologize....i see no way out@@4
648@@ I wish I could kill myself but I know I won't. I just wish I had someone to talk to.@@3
649@@ Hi All Its not very often that i feel this low.It takes a lot. Something really petty has triggered it all. So last night i wasn't feeling in the best of moods and i had originally said id go out to see a band play. I decided to chill out at home... at first. So as always it involved a girl... my sister in law texted me and said oh are you coming out then? i was like no, she was oh but sadie (the girl i like) was really hoping you'd be here. I was like ohhhhhhhh ok give me a while and ill be there. Do anyway, i went there and she had gone. I was just like i really can't be arsed and long story short we all ended up back at my sister in laws place. I got talking with her and she had already turned round and said no its okay. Im not looking for anything serious. I was just like i feel like I've been taken the piss out of. I didn't want to go out. I wasn't expecting anything from this girl. She told people she liked me and it wasn't the case. That mixed with a really shitty couple of weeks. Being told I'm not good enough, Realising people were right about me all along. Remember things that happened when i was younger. I just hit rock bottom last night. I phoned my friend and this looked up and a very long tearful conversation on the phone and i felt worse. I done something on impulse which i shouldn't have done. But, i did anyway. It was self harming but in a completely unorthodox way. I just fail to see anyway up these days... its getting harder and harder in a cruel world that doesn't understand me. I want people to understand but I fear that they won't or can't!@@3
650@@ I don't really know what I'm expecting to gain from this but I looked at some other threads and was inspired to talk about my own suicide/depression issues. My major problems, I'm the baby of the family so my parents never made me do anything, I lashed out at them spent time in treatment and I realized how much life sucked being away from home. So I've been good to them ever since, but the enabling never stopped. So after I quit school and sat on my butt for almost 5 years. (somehow got my GED) and my parents finally realized that I was wasting away in my own depression, lack of ambition, friends and motivation. So they gave me the necessary swift kick in the rear end I always needed, they kicked me out. I've been at my sister's for about 3 months, I have a job, had a girlfriend(who I broke up with because I'm stupid.) and I've realized that none of this makes me happy. I don't feel particularly better and I think about suicide everyday. I feel like life is a facade of exchanging stupid pleasantries and just getting through the day. What's the point? Not to mention the way the world is and how people are changing into something disgusting. I don't want to be apart of this game anymore, but I still persevere. I'm on the edge and I'm always waiting for something to either push me over or pull me back from it. I don't know what I want from life and I find some comfort in thinking about what waits for me after it. Be it hell, heaven or whatever unknown afterlife, I don't really care anymore. I'm not going to kill myself, just expressing my feelings. I can't confide in anyone in my life because it would turn into a huge fiasco so I just lie and say I'm great. Thanks for reading.@@2
